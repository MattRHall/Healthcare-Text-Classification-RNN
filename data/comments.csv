5876,"I was told I wasnt allowed in with my house mate as I was over the age of 21. However multiple people after me came after me with partners and parents. Being left on my own for 3 hours in the agony I was in was extremely distressing. When I was finally seen, I was told by 2 doctors that there was nothing they could do. I wasnt given advice about after care or where to go from here, was just simply told that it cant be helped. I had dislocated my shoulder so clearly something had been done to help. I feel so let down."
6555,Imagine telling a Rheumatoid Arthritis sufferer who has severely bad trapped nerves in her wrists that she's not entitled her to a certain drug because it's too expensive and she's not poorly enough. I am livid. @SouthTees an official complaint will be made #NHS #rheumatology
1448,"Not exactly loved, but good to go when it's required. Parking adequate but always need to get there early if you have an appointment. Staff are helpful and friendly, treatment centre is an added bonus taking pressure from more conventional areas."

7541,"I would like to send Mr Gallagher and all his staff, including admissions, theatre, recovery and Ludlow ward for all their kindness, excellent treatment and sheer professionalism during my stay for knee replacement last week. I could not have asked for more attention or better treatment at the hands of the staff at the hospital. The best hospital in the country in my opinion. Thanks you so much."

3814,"I have attended a hospital appointment @uclh yesterday, nobody from reception to doctors were wearing any sort of Protective equipment.Not to mention that all the hand sanitizers were giving out not alcohol based solution but some sort of watery foam with no scent or alcohol #NHS"
4023,I was treated attentively with a lot of kindness and professionalism.
4189,"Accident and emergency services - Excellent care and help. - I was admitted after a fall with severe hip pain. From the ambulance crew right through to Injuries, and majors ward staff, they were all so caring, helpful and professional. They did everything they could to help ease my pain, being understanding and towards my being discharged . To making sure I would be safe in my home, I cannot thank them all enough for all their hard work, dedication and cheerfulness, especially so in these stressful times. A lot of people should try and walk a day in their shoes to realise what wonderful work they do. Many thanks. "
9246,No compassion shown to people with autism - On the 8th of July after not being seen by anybody from Community Mental Health since November. well I've been denied help and much needed medication to help with meltdowns and with anxiety it has been denied to me by Community Mental Health. after several months I've not been seen by a single person in community mental health when no appointments were made and my condition was left to get out of control whereby got more and more agitated and my panic attacks and may go missing on several occasions which could have been stopped and prevented by Community Mental Health. I was given no help and support whatsoever as a person with autism and other mental health conditions. I don't know the 8th of July get a letter from Community Mental Health saying that I'm being discharged this LED to my melted down that I had at Folly Hall Mills on that day . I was not met with compassion and neither did I meet with anybody who try to calm me down and bring me out of my mouth down. if I had been successfully handled on that day by somebody who had any understanding of autism and how best to treat me. I may not have gone into the state that I was in and may not have gotten worse.. I feel like I've been discriminated against by the way in which I was treated on the 8th of July. even by one of the people who is part of the team that i was under last year. back in November I went missing I told people that I was going to take my own life which was fully intent on doing. I was taken to Pinderfields Hospital I was assessed by 3 professionals. To see if I needed to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act. on the night of me go missing back in November I was re referred back to community mental health. and I was only ever seen once in November and since November going up until the start of the lockdown I have not been seen a anybody from Community Mental Health. nothing left to Fester and for my conditions to get worse and worst of all . nobody did anything to sort out a much needed medication that Community Mental Health should have been sorting out with me. maybe if they had of been doing their job properly the meltdown that I had last week might have been stopped I consider Community Mental Health actions in all of this to not be acceptable . I struggle with my problems and my difficulties and at best expect to be met with compassion and professionalism. Neither of which I have seen . I have been left a faster with my problems over tow many months. my desire to want to kill myself it's gotten worse and yes I've been told and some have made progress I wish I knew what the progress was. I've been cut off for more services . and i have been left in the real state not just mentally but my social care needs are not being met at all. I have felt very much on my own I'm with no help from Community Mental Health when I very much needed help. 
9004,"My Rheumatology team are starting me on a new medication as I have come out of remission. Within days of the decision I received a phone call from a Lister Hospital pharmacist who gave me information about the drug and their delivery service, giving me lots of opportunities to ask questions. The medication was delivered to my house the following day. I missed the delivery at first because I didn't hear the door bell, and my mobile phone was in a different room. I rang the driver, Ian I think, when I realised he'd left me a message and he came straight back to my address! What an absolute star! He was very professional, and if it hadn't been for Covid restrictions, I could have hugged him! Thank you for your excellent service all round. I am so grateful. Teresa"
4646,"I would like to share my horror visits experience with this so called A&E department. I have abdomnial pain for two month now. It is severe and sometimes I can not take it anymore, because it gets unbearable. I am still do not have diagnose. They will not make any investigations necessary. I have been to A&E two times with the pains that I can not walk anymore. One time I even did not go, because of what they do. Both times I was given painkillers and showeled out. This is the way how they work in this place. Last time when I was there I pressed red button for an hour till somebody came. I am in a bed at home and can not do anything else now, because it is so bad now. If you need help this is the last place where to go, because you will not get it there. These doctors gave Hippocratic Oath."

194,My husband spent time on one.of the wards after surgery I called it the ward from hell no communication no one answered the phone even although we couldn't visit that is understandable they allowed other patients to play music in the middle of the night their was little empathy and the nurses screaming at patients in the middle of the night.i know nurses are bust but they took minimum 10 min to answer the buzzer and I could go on and on I hope noone has to suffer the way My husband did

2814,"'Brilliant Service' - I am e-mailing you on behalf of my elderly neighbour. She would like to thank the two Paramedics who turned up so promptly to assisist her after falling. They were so patient, kind, caring and efficient and she can't praise them enough. She wanted you to know. I would endorse that wholeheartedly too, having been a nurse for some years and appreciated the fact that they kept us informed about what was happening and paid attention to detail, which reassured my very anxious neighbour. We would like them to receive the feedback and I know their names, but how can we get this message to them? Once again many, many thanks."

5294,"I first called 111 at 4am about a possible ankle fracture and they told me it needed to be treated within the hour and that they would get someone to call me back and book me into the urgent treatment centre. 2 hours later I received no communication and I called again, they didn't seem to want to deal with it and simply offered to write a note that I had called. I asked if I could go to A&E instead which they agreed I could. I arrived at A&E without having eaten or drunk for the whole day (as per 111s instruction) and waited for an hour before being told to go to the minor injuries unit (without any help), I had to limp the painful journey to the other building. I then waited for a further 3.5 hours before being told they couldn't look at me because they were closing and gave me a pair of crutches to get home and recommended I come back in the morning. I then called 111 again when I got back and realised a purple bruise had developed and the swelling had gotten worse. They then told me to go back to A&E, where I was told I had lost my place in the queue and I would have to wait another 7 hours, (despite my condition and the fact I was promised by the minor injuries staff that I would keep my place). I still haven't been seen almost 12 hours later and my have permanent damage to my foot."

2782,"Was transfered to A&E at Wexham after out of hours GP checked up my son (22 months), we came with vomiting, high temperature, rash and fast heartbeat. GP wasnt sure so wanted pediatrician to give 2nd opinion. We were put in own room stright away and my son could watch cartoons whole time. It started with amazing service and super helpful and friendly staff turned into 8 hours wait. We waited all night, little one couldnt sleep and his heartrate only increased due to being distressed, i wasnt very happy either as there is nothing for parent to even rest on while little one snoozes off, couldnt go to toilet as he started crying as soon as i put him down, we run out of nappies as wasnt ready or thougt will need to wait so long, he started to be hungry as his vomiting calmed down and there is nothing to have, thankfully staff offered some biscuits of theirs. Really should think of something as waiting times are so long. So at 6am doctor came checked him for 2 mins said its a stomach bug and rash is related to virus in tummy and said we are free to go. One of staff members who was checking his heartrate said we cant go home until it falls and it only got higher but doctor said to go home. So we came home (live 5 mins away) and i noticed that rash already started turn into blisters and i was sure its chicken pox. How can a doctor misdiagnose so common childhood illness? No wonder people rather google symptoms than go to A&E. Which could lead to serious issues if child is seriously ill. But i personally dont have trust in these services anymore and very disappointed with how it was dealt with. We are 2 days in and it is 100 percent chickenpox we dealing with. I would like to thank staff for being patient with us though."
6620,"Accident and emergency services - Joined up working - I felt unwell on Saturday, 29th February early morning and was taken to A and E by ambulance. The crew were very professional, kind and caring. They talked with me, reassuring me there was plenty of time to help me calm down. The A and E staff were expecting me and quickly organised a series of tests. X-rays, and scans. At all times they explained what they wanted to do and why. They realised that my husband, who was with me, needed support as his memory is not very good and he was worried they treated him with care and respect at all times. The whole team, medical, nursing, x-ray, scan, physiotherapists and social workers were an excellent example of working together in a professional and encouraging way and, thanks to this we were both able to go home mid-afternoon. Thank you all."
8721,"we would just like to say thank you so much to Leona and Ruth for everything they did for us this morning helping deliver our little girl into the world, I have had 2 children at the general and always wanted to have my children at melton. the experience was second to none! professional and personal at the same time. to think we could lose this service is a devastation to our town it really is!

955,"Mental Health - Child and Adolescent - Dangerous - Took a 16 year, too see the doctor, they been under camhs then this department. No one is actually listening, the patient is on the asd spectrum, not diagnosed. The doctor previously wanted the person to be screened via London hospital for ASD. All the symptoms are there, self harm, voices, severe anxiety, low mood, suicide thoughts. The school have agreed its ASD and asked for the person to be seen by a doctor. The doctor said there's nothing he can do, because the person seems non compliant, you ask ASD person questions, you got yes and no, asd struggle socially. The person wanted to try medication, as last time, a significant change happened, witnessed via school, home. Sadly the patient believed the medication was tracking them. So refused to take them. I am going to now take this persons case further for legal action, since being involved with both teams, no one has managed to get anywhere, a young person life been drastically changed due to no one listening to what they are saying and everyone seems to have a short memory on there own notes. During this time the young person who once was doing well at school, now is going to fail exams, and will end up being another adult with mental health issues that don't get treated for. Disappointed taking legal advice "

7515,"I am writing on behalf of a relative, who went to A and E in severe pain only to be told he was putting the whole hospital at risk by coming in. The nurses were very rude and unprofessional and made him feel very uncomfortable. While he waited for hours in an empty A and E several nurses stood around chatting. The hospital is obviously not overwhelmed."
4990,"My dad's hip replacement - My dad is 58 years old truck driver from Slovakia, travelling all around the EU. His truck broke down after collecting a load in Devon on his way to France so it had to be towed to a local garage near Exeter. When they pulled at the garage, my dad got out of his truck not realising that the front axle was still lifted by the tow truck resulting in stepping into the void. My dad found himself on a tarmac in pain on his left leg not being able to move. Fortunately, there was the tow truck driver seeing what happened and calling an ambulance right away. My dad had his mobile phone in his pocket so he called me to help him as he doesn't speak English. He ended up in the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in Durbin Ward. What happened there was well beyond my expectations. Every time I got a phone call from a doctor, nurse or anyone else involved in my dad's case I was treated friendly and professionally. I know it's a hospital so they don't have time for any long conversations, which is why they were sometimes brief, but clear and to the point and I absolutely appreciate it. Because my dad doesn't speak the language, it was difficult on both sides so they called me to help with translation whether it was for some questions or information or when the physiotherapists helped my dad to exercise. That was a fun one even though a bit painful for my dad so I heard a lot of groaning and giggling at the same time HAPPY Fortunately, I currently study in Norwich, UK, so it was a bit easier to come to visit my dad after his operation. He was obviously in very good hands. Regardless of the pain, he felt good and well taken care of. He said so himself. Even with the language barrier, the nurses did such a good job taking good care of him. I met the surgeon operating my dad on a hallway, clearly very busy running somewhere. I don't even know how she knew who I was, but as she walked by, she just told me that the operation of my dad went well without any complications and he'll be well soon. The way she said it was so cheerful and full of energy, I couldn't believe what just happened, but she put me well at ease. I could virtually see the smile under the face mask she was wearing. You don't expect such positive energy from a person constantly under stress working their ass off for others. Then I met the main nurse, doctor and other nurses. All the worries in my head went puff. So much was happening around and yet they managed to speak to me, attend to my dad and everything was just working like a clock.I do some activism for equality and sign a lot of petitions here in the UK. They are often about NHS. This was my second experience with the NHS. One in Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital a year ago and now the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital. Both hospitals proved me that fighting for NHS by signing petitions and support its staff is the least I should do. Thank you so much for being there and do what you do every day even for non-English speaking foreign truck drivers HAPPY"

Very poor communication re place on the operating list, minimal if any update whilst waiting to go down to theatre. Little care post op once back on the ward. Minimal aftercare advice, nothing advised about the wound care or physio given! Assessed as DVT risk, no medication given. The wrong details on the record given to me to take away and sent to the Gp. Felt as if the staff were wanting to close the unit to get home"

She said she didnt know what was wrong with me, she shrugged, she was rude and dismissive, and she sent me out of the department to go home with my cannula still in. I was in the car park before I realised. I am still in considerable pain and now scared to ask anyone for help because she made me feel it was pointless."

455,"I would like so share my experience at Milton Keynes hospital, I was admitted on the 8th June to be induced . I was asked to come in at 5.30 pm as there was a shortage of beds. My induction was delayed due to high demand and shortage of staff . After having started my induction I was told I would not need to continue as things were progressing but there was a long wait on labour ward . I waited 2 day's and was seen by consultant who then said we could not proceed and would ...need to start induction again . I had been in hospital 5 days and by that point was rather fed up. I had to make the decision to have a c section, this was my last resort but I felt after one failed induction I did not want to put my body through that . My c section took place on the 14th June, a very scary procedure I had never had experienced. My surgeon was sonny and I can not thank him enough and his team for making me feel calm and at ease . The ward staff are absolutely amazing on ward 9 from the domestic staff up to the doctors and consultants . The maternity unit would most definitely benefit with more staff and ward 10 being opened again the staff are extremely stretched and doing their Best But without the right amount of staff the correct care is not able to be given.

9580,"The staff are usually busy but you expect that of our woefully underfunded NHS staff. However, I have always found them to be helpful and have always dealt with my family and I as best they can."
2099,"Inpatient experience - I was admitted with severe migraines ‚Äî spent 10 days as an inpatient. It took three days for me to have an MRI. Some healthcares were rude to me, and acted inappropriately ‚Äî rolling eyes when I said I was in pain & making out I was not being honest. Some nurses would deny my medication when I requested more pain relief, even though I was able to have a stronger relief. It was 10 days as a nineteen year old without my mum, I requested support for my anxiety and feel like I'd been lied to over certain things ‚Äî being told my bloods were clotting in accident and emergency, but then being told they was fine? "
4770,"Amazing service - After being let down by my own doctor (again) I attended the W / in centre, I was immediately put at ease by the nurse taking my details with in 5 mins I was called in to be seen by the same nurse, the girl was so professional and assured me I had not got (Shingles) which was the reason I was there, 5 mins later I was walking up Rockingham Street with a prescription, amazing people, Thankyou"

7566,"Phones go continually unanswered - I know that with COVID hospital visiting has to be restricted but you would have thought that wards might have employed temp staff to answer the phones so I could enquire as to how my very poorly mother is (or any close friend / family member is). Instead the phones have gone continually unanswered . Plus I heard yesterday that Broomfield has moved its COVID ward right next to a ward for the elderly. I feel that is thoughtless, dangerous and uncaring."

4024,"Had a routine medical scan today. Cost with insurance as hospital outpatient would have been $750. Called central billing and they sent me to an off site clinic in the same health care system. Same procedure, $287. Lesson learned to call around if non-emergency! "
1162,"Worst Hospital in London! We have had multiple bad experiences here. The last experience they kept our 1 year old waiting in urgent care for near on 4 hours. We left without being seen because we didn't want to keep her for so long. They saw every adult twice over before her. They made multiple false excuses saying she was priority but couldn't actually be a priority?!! Makes no sense. They didn't acknowledge their negligence and were incredibly rude. Another instance my wife had gone multiple times for stomach pain while pregnant and she was given no follow up care, months later she had to be induced because her placenta had stopped feeding our baby‚Ä¶..a result of‚Ä¶.a womb infection, the source of her pain. We are lucky our baby is alive. Another instance we saw a woman ring the emergency alarm in a&e toilet for 40 minutes, she dragged herself out of the dirty wee stained toilet (I know because I used it) after having given birth to a baby that wasn't crying. They then didn't clean the blood, it looked like a crime scene, for an hour and a half. People in a&e were crying, it was so traumatic. Another instance my wife had been complaining about heavy bleeding and visited multiple times, with no treatment months later she miscarried and when she was taken to hospital by ambulance they dismissed her saying it was impossible and when they saw the remains actually acknowledged what happened, they then threw the remains away without consultation with her. In every scenario this hospital has tried to cover up its incompetence and negligence. The staff should acknowledge the failings of the hospital and be more transparent, like ‚ÄúI'm sorry its not good enough, you're right, but let me see what else I can do‚Äù would make a huge difference instead they double down on the bad service and make it so much worse. The staff are honestly incredibly rude. There is no excuse for this. This hospital either needs shutting down or overhauling, there is literally no point in having a beloved NHS if this is how poor it is. The staff behave like there is no quality to be expected take what you can get, if you can survive it's your good luck. It's disgusting. If that is your take on it. Quit your job in health care, because clearly you DO NOT CARE."
1030,"General Surgery - Amazing care - Had recent gallbladder surgery, absolutely amazing care from outpatient appointment thro to after care .consultant was extremely caring clear and compassionate fully explaining what was going to happen in an easy to understand way, he has a wonderful bedside manner and left minimal scarring.

8674,"Don't know - A&E to Minors and out again - thank you!! - Given the pressure that everyone is under, the need to limit footfall through the hospital and the genuine desire to be as efficient as possible I was amazed at the way I was treated. From turning up at A&E through to x-ray and being treated I was there for no more than 3 hours which, given all the factors, I think was a very quick service. Throughout my visit I was kept informed of what would be happening, expectations managed with regards to how long things would take and all of the staff seemed genuinely engaged in the patient experience.

7180,"Accident and emergency services - Professional and most efficient services - I was very positively impressed by the efficiency and professionalism of the staff in A&G - very quick and comprehensive analysis was done by the team of doctors and nurses to assess my situation and conclude what was the problem. Further excellent service and professional help was provided by the medical team. They were very thorough and detailed with assessing the problem and kept me in the ward as long as needed, until the doctor felt safe for me to be released. I spent almost a week at the hospital, and every day was impressed by the high level of standard in everything, from caters to nurses, and especially doctors. Truly appreciate NHS for everything, and being proud for such a high level of quality and professionalism in UK national health services! "
3861,In these strange times @WinghornPress and I are reeling with joy to have safely welcomed this beautiful little fellow this week.

4002,"Orthopaedics - Great Hospital - This last year more than ever the public have learnt to appreciate the NHS. In God's own county of Yorkshire we are fortunate to have Airedale Hospital as a beacon of love and hope in the darkest times. It is a tribute to the management and staff that everything appears to go so well in such a large organisation and work force. The documentation about the operation was excellent and useful. The buildings are kept beautifully clean and all the staff from the humblest cleaner had a cherry smile for everyone. The food was excellent and they could even read minds and bring a cup of tea and biscuit at the right moment. All the nurses on Ward 18 went way and beyond expectations. No one ever seems to have an off day. I was in for a new knee and I took it for granted that the surgeon, was a man at the peak of his profession to hold the job at Airedale. What I discovered was the extras that came with his abilities. I was treated as an individual. He spent time talking to me to allay all my fears. He was obviously a great team motivator, he conveyed a calm air, everyone knew their job and worked together. His anesthetist I single out for particular praise, he really looked after me by my side every minute during the operation. The surgeon said to me when I was on the operating table that the only surprise I would get was when I was told the job was finished. He was right, absolutely no pain. Thanks. "
6013,"Most important message of the day, if you have any irregular bleeding, no matter how small, please get checked out. It might just save your life - it is saving mine. Thank you to the wonderful @NHSHomerton for looking after me #bladdercancer #WorldCancerDay"

3175,"3 or 4 | It was a super long wait. I know thats not your fault. Also the doctors didnt give me many details about my results which I asked for. I felt like the staff dismissed my dizziness as down to dehydration from drinking but Im sure its not that because Im still having the same problems days later. I understand its not an accident or emergency to feel dizzy and sick for a week, but 999 told me to go in to the hospital so its a bit of a catch 22"
460,"Don't know - Appalling - inhuman - After speaking to an out of hours GP I was advised to go to Scarborough Accident and Emergency Department. The experience was absolutely shocking. I appreciate that public services are underfunded, understaffed and stretched, but some simple changes could be made to treat patients feel like humans. Given that patients experience long waits to be seen access to water and food is essential. Patients cannot be expected to go without access to these for periods in excess of 6 hours. Even a vending machine would suffice. When I asked I was offered an can of water while they lasted. After they had gone, there was no access unless you drank water from the taps in the toilets. There was an elderly lady who had been there 3 hours longer than me. She had not eaten or drank for 9 hours. The seating is so uncomfortable for excessive periods of waiting. People with injuries, neck or back issues cannot sit in these chairs for extended periods of time. It triggered a cervicogenic migraine for me which I am still suffering with the following day. There was a lady who had injured her back and could not sit down. She was there longer than me (5 hours) and she stood the entire time, hanging on to the back of a chair. A simple change to address this would be to have the high backed chairs I have seen at my local hospital or the type you see at day centres. There were not enough chairs. After having bloods taken I came back to the waiting room to find it full. I ended up sitting on the floor by the entrance. It was not covid safe due to lack of space and seating. There was also a patient coughing continuously yet he was left in the waiting room. There were parents with babies who had no where to sit. I was completely shocked at the experience. This is the UK in 2021 where sick and injured patients are left in a crowded room for in excess of 6 hours without access to adequate seating, food and water. We were all cannulated so we couldn't just leave. In the end, with a migraine triggered and no longer being able to cope with the pain in those conditions I asked for the cannula to be removed and left in a far worse condition than I arrived in and a reoccurrence of a next injury cause by not being able to sit properly which has triggered a migraine. People understand that the NHS is underfunded and when you need treatment you are likely to have to wait a considerable length of time, but we also expect to be treated as humans, able to sit and have access to water and food."
5832,"So sad to hear that we have lost another of our #NHSnurses...Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong, had worked for five years at @LandDHospital where she died on Sunday. Her baby was delivered safely after her death. Blessings to baby & Mary's family. https://t.co/2KU1mMFMlo"
9340,"I had to wait 30 minutes but whats more, the consultant I usually see was isolating and so I was seen by a different consultant. That meant I had to explain my medical history again. I should have been given the choice to wait to see my regular consultant. Particularly since cancer follow ups can be complex and an emotional strain, they are not just any old check up. Please consider the well-being of your patients. Id waited for months I could have waited for another 2 weeks for a much more satisfactory outcome.

I have cognitive issues and severe anxiety, the lady on the phone was so rude and told me off for not answering my phone when I was driving. She gave me no alternative avenue to go through was just rude and unhelpful. For people who work up the courage to ring these places, they need more respect.

If you are reading this and need to see a Dr but are putting it off because of the pandemic, please think again.There really is nothing to fear."

4179,Neonatal Care - Best experience I've ever had - Was referred to this hospital after being told that our baby has an exomphalos. Straight away me and my partner noticed how clean the hospital was and how friendly all the staff was. The specialists were so compassionate and happy to answer any of our questions that we had which we felt other hospitals were lacking. This hospital have definitely restored my faith in the nhs. 11/10.
5346,"They supported us - When my my Husband was first diagnosed with Alzheimer's at age 54 our whole family was rocked. We didn't know what to do and felt our whole future as a family had been demolished overnight! After a rocky start with the initial diagnosis and allocation of support the working age dementia team sprung into action and quickly became part of our world. They supported us with emotional and dementia strategies to support us through the initial stages as we came to terms with his diagnosis and prognosis for the future. They very quickly became one of the main players in paving the way to our new way of life and were always there to lend a hand or an ear when we just needed someone to talk to. There was a lot of work to be done at the outset; forms to fill in, access to other areas of support - it felt, at times, very overwhelming. But, with their support and guidance the stress of all of this was lessened and they were our guides, every step of the way. My husband is very young and the activities and support that he needs is very different to many. The WAD team have adapted a lot of their programmes to make him feel welcome and to ensure that he feels included in activities. We are now three years since his diagnosis and whilst we have been discharged by the team, I know that I can still contact them when things get tough or have a query. The team are absolutely brilliant - they have had to adjust during the pandemic and have seen funding cuts to their teams but still carry on with their excellent support to patients and their families when they need it the most."
8573,Great practice - My husband and myself had our flu jabs today and we were so impressed with how it had been organised 
4037,"An absolute disgrace of a hospital. rude nurses and HCA that refuse to provide patients water or support when requested. You are ignored and refused medical treatment. COVID-19 positive patients are mixed with patients who are negative and are not informed of the positive patients. Unless another patient over hears a nurse in charge informing staff to not approach a positive patient for their own health and safety risk. Why is it that other Patients life can be put on line and are not informed of the infection risk. FY1 & FY2 doctors cant even read or interpret CTI or MRI scans. the funniest part is that they advice patient to go Nil By Mouth for the surgery and then to be told by the surgeon that they are not going for an operation due to the CTI and MRI reports. I though medical doctors were meant to be trained and competent before been allowed on to wards with vulnerable patients. Oldham hospital is a Joke, they don't care and are all hiding behind COVID-19 and leaving patients to suffer. Been Told if you don't like it go private - why are we paying our taxes then."
6549,"The reason I gave my answer. ..I was seen quickly and everything was discussed with me, the person I saw was very interested in me and really concerned with my well being, and she is making me an appointment with a consultant to discuss how we are going to move forward....I am very pleased with the treatment I received. ..thank you"

2154,"Keeping patients in the loop - Firstly, I must say that the hospital is beautiful, clean and the staff on the ground are incredible. My issue is with the procedure waiting time and keeping patients in the loop. I found this intolerable. I have spent the last two years sleeping in a chair because of reflux. I waited over a year to be seen and have a bravo fitted under sedation. This was unsuccessful so I was put on the list to have the procedure under a general anaesthetic. I called almost every week, desperate for the procedure and was told each time by the head nurse that as soon as the list became available, I would be put on it. I had a missed call on Monday so I called on Tuesday I was so excited to finally get an appointment, and see the light at the end of the tunnel finally. What I was told was that I hadn't been put on the list and would have to wait until August to see if I was put on then. I couldn't believe my ears. It felt so cruel and unnecessary that I hung up and burst into tears. I have depression and PTSD, and it triggered me. The thought of having to suffer indefinitely was almost too much to cope with. I can't stop crying. I feel betrayed and mislead. It's unacceptable to treat people this way."

8330,"Don't know - Amazing 'all inclusive' - As above 'Amazing all Inclusive' that's what the name band on my wrist gave me, Health Care, food, drink, and the view was great to. Spent 24 hours in hospital for incision and drainage of an abscess between first 4b and then 4a ward. All the staff are absolutely Fantastic, Caring, Smiling and Professional these are people who literally save lives everyday, we can never pay them enough because they are priceless. Nurses, Cleaners, Doctors, Anaesthetists, Cooks, Porter, Surgeons, Receptionist, and the lady in the shop who scanned 33 bars of chocolate for the above, good job I was only there for one day really everyone would need the dentist.

7666,The car park is hard to find and very full. You have to get a permit to park and pop it back to your car ASAP. I then had to queue again to try and work out where my appointment was as it was my first and didnt know where to go. All a bit chaotic really.
2202,Having a DVT in the past always puts you on high alert when something doesn't feel right. Thank you to the amazing staff at Warwick hospital @NHSuk @NHSMillion @NHS for looking after & reassuring me today. üôèüèΩ#dvt #bloodclot #bloodclots #VTE #WorldThrombosisDay #WTD2020

6491,Hate to hear so many say things about a hospital / doctor without justification. @lj_punch saved my life and leg at big Barnes. I hate she has stepped ways cause Lord knows I need her again but now I'm reluctant with the virus so strong so I am just doing what I can and praying.

5255,Thank you @NorthBristolNHS for providing such an amazing service today! #Vaccinations I felt thoroughly looked after! 
7323,We referred by 111 and advised to go to Ealing hospital asap. Waited for 3 hours to be treated by Urgent care for a 9 month old. After 3 hours of wait we approched reception and they had no clue of when our baby will get treated. We were under impression that babies have priority and also when he is not well for more then a week. We asked for a manager to know the status as receptionist had no clue. Finally someone came and saw our baby but was not able to treat him and instead send us to West Middlesex hospital to wait for another 4 hours. Dont take your baby at this hospital.
7591,food care information at each stage staff friendly and informative
4627,"Imaging services - Calming radiographer - I had never had an MRI before, and was a little nervous. The radiographer met me, talked me through what would happen and then wheeled me slowly round to the room. He made me feel very relaxed and I was able to remain calm through the whole process. I think going at a calm, unhurried pace was good, if he had made me feel rushed it would have been counterproductive and taken much longer in the end as 20 minutes inside a noisy machine could easily have set off a panic attack but it did not. After my scan I left the room smiling. I wished I had said a bigger thank you in person at the time so Thank you. Please tell your staff thank you. "
3856,Visit to Radiology CT department @RDEhospitals this afternoon. Excellent care from the Advanced Radiography Practitioner. Thank you.
2459,"I spent 10 days in Maidstone hospital from 13Dec on life support, my family not knowing if I was going to pull through.

5207,I attended MIU Monday 11/7/21. Seen immediately. Had hurt foot on holiday. Diagnosed x-rayed and plastered in 2 hours. Very friendly and efficient. Also dealt very efficiently when passing on details to my home hospital. I wish it was my home hospital. I cannot rate them too highly.
6722,"Problems with my voice - About 2 years ago I started to loose my voice with a cough, I kept going to the Dr getting antibiotics and told it would go away, started to get worse so I was finally sent to ear, nose. throat, they couldn't find anything wrong, even though I sounded really bad, so they finally referred me to the voice therapist, I though it will never work, but after a few weeks of doing some therapy with my voice it's helped alot, sometimes it goes but most of the time my voice is back to normal can't thank them enough"
2836,"I have been trying to get an appointment at my General Practice, and have been been told that there are no appointments for three weeks, I've just come out of hospital and am a pensioner. I was discharged from Torbay Hospital. The Lancashire GPs need more Doctors and money spent"

3712,Staff have been great  | Nothing thank you
2278,"Dermatology - Very good - As a result of the treatment there recently, I highly recommend the Dermatology Department at Amersham Hospital. I am afraid I did not take the name of the two ladies who saw me yesterday to carry out the minor surgery on my nose (I was so nervous that most of yesterday was a daze) but would be grateful if my thanks could be passed on to them. Their kindness, professionalism and care and their consideration in ensuring that the excision was as minimal as possible, made the procedure less traumatic and I would be grateful if you would pass on my thanks to them and the receptionists at Amersham Hospital Dermatology Department. "
4729,Giving birth in a relaxed environment - The wonderful staff enabled me to give birth to my son in a relaxed and very professional yet nurturing environment during lockdown
2021,"HORRIBLE! I was in A&E and I had a serious wound, and after 5 hours was I finally admitted where they shouted at me apparently it wasn't serious enough to be in A&E. They did nothing and I went to another hospital to get treated. It was only the reception staff, they should be replaced. The doctors and nurses are very kind to children."
454,"My Xmas Eve is going to be spend @Derriford_Hosp, waiting on a knee clinic appointment. My 2nd xmas in a row under Orthopaedics. I really hope I won't need them, but I really hope these amazing @UHP_NHS people are still here in 5 years time..."
4246,Amazing staff on the peanut ward. Cant thank them enough üëç
2391,Maternity services - Absolutely poor department - I went into the maternity day care unit due to reduced movements and feeling unwell. When I attended I was seen to by a lovely midwife who reassured me that baby was ok but from other tests and how I was feeling advised me to wait and see the Doctor she did tell me she wasn't aware how long this was going to be. This midwife and a student midwife who was also lovely. The shifts changed over and I was left waiting in a side room I was aware of this so wasn't to worried. I was then asked to leave my room and wait in the waiting due to another woman needing to be assessed. I sat in the waiting room and the new midwife on shift who obviously doesn't realise that you can hear everything said in the waiting room then called through to the doctor to tell him / her about the patients whom were waiting .... she then proceeded to state about me after other women on ward that ‚ÄúI wasn't going to leave I had demanded to see a doctor‚Äù do I really want to sit around for 3 hours waiting for a doctor if I am not advised to? I was then asked by another midwife to follow her over to the labour ward which I did as she had called my name and asked me to. When I got to the labour ward the midwife started asking me questions which I was answering extremely oddly to her because they had taken the wrong woman over to labour ward there was only 3 of us in day care!!! When I returned to day care I was then advised that the doctor would be to busy to see me due to an emergency and that the midwife would get me a prescription and I could leave. After the second half of my experience in the day care I am not really anxious to call as feel like I am constantly being judged and asp concerned that the major mistakes being made when the ward is so quiet what will happen if the ward if busy gives me no confidence at all. 
771,"The great care, kindness and smiling faces all the time."
4618,Yes the wait time is long but you will get treated. Doctors and nurses were all very lovely and attentive. Cannot fault at all.
5360,Over 5 hour wait. Go here if you dont value your life.
6779,"Don't know - Radiology Department Wonderful Staff - I attended the Radiology Department 30/11 for a routine dexa scan.From the Receptionist on entering the department, to the Radiology staff, they were kind, considerate, on time and I felt as if I was treated as a person and not a hospital number as I have experienced unfortunately in some larger hospitals.Its a pity some of the treatments they used to offer have now been moved to St James.I would highly recommend choosing this hospital if possible to do so.They were also much nicer and efficient than a private hospital radiology department which I attended in West Yorkshire."
5423,THANK YOU Swinton and Oldham @Morrisons from ICU @SalfordRoyalNHS for your kind (and very large!) donations for our staff! #NHSThankYou
24,We experienced everything in a pleasant and friendly way and in a bright atmosphere.
4986,Always very attentive and polite staff
9447,Incomplete treatment - My BCG instillation treatment for Bladder cancer stopped after one year. Missed my 6 month BCG in April due to Covid lockdown. Waited 4 months before asking to restart after cystoscopy. I attribute my recovery to the BCG treatment. I feel that the policy decision to discontinue treatment after one year is high risk. It is like not finishing your antibiotics. Meanwhile the anxiety of incomplete cancer treatment continues.
1399,"Warm welcome, waited only 30mins, received effective, professional and courteous treatment."
387,Free for 2 hours
4342,"The person conducting my hearing test was making noises at her desk, writing and mouse movements, not helping listening to the beeps. Doctor was excellent."
7325,From A and E to Guildford ward to Eashing ward all staff were very friendly caring and helpful. Doctors and nurses were very thorough in their investigation and assessment. An excellent example of NHS at its best
9418,"The service is excellent, you usually have a long wait"
2711,Covid restrictions in OP 2 were admirable as was the assistance provided by the sister and nursing staff. However my experience with the consultant reminded me of the 1950s Doctor patient relationship. He did not greet me in any way when I entered his room. He was not interested in me as a person and did not want to listen to what I wanted to say. I am a retired chief nurse and principal of a school of nursing
1324,Easy parking with lots of parking . But busy times can be a problem. With a lot of people fighting for lower parking spaces.
5849,Competence
1740,Gynaecology - Efficient Experience - Was seen very quickly on my consultant appointment who was also very clear in explaining any issue and answered all queries I had. Doctor was very understanding and I felt well looked after. Only had to wait a week before my pre-op appt was booked in - all very efficient! Nothing but praise for the gynaecological team from consultants to physiotherapists. Keep up the good work.
9765,I would like to thank all of the staff at urology for helping my Dad yesterday. They went above and beyond to give us the best support we could have asked for! Thank you so much x
4845,In and out very quick. Very good.
4385,"Barium meal swallow test - Quite simply fantastic, I way very nervous before going in but the young lady that looked after me was lovely. In the letter I received from the hospital it stated that would have to remove my clothes and put on a gown but no I walked straight in to the room and on to the table The barium solution tasted fine which shocked me. The radiologist was very nice and reassuring. I can't praise them enough! ! ! üòÄ"
6031,"Grateful to have had my first dose of the Covid vaccine today - quick, easy and painless! Thank you @MTWnhs and @kmptnhs"
6334,"Wasn't explained as to why tests were being taken, wasn't informed of waiting times, was told may need steroid inhaler but no medicine given at visit. Only went as 111 GP asked me to and made to fell as overall I shouldn't have been there even though I didn't want to put on AnE myself. 111GP told me that a chest xray was needed and A and E didn't do this and didn't explain why.  | Well try and treat people that have tried to see a GP rather than attend accident and emergency nicer. It is not our fault we have been advised to attend. It's hard cause it puts on the service I realise, but that's the protocols fault not the patient "
5753,Excellent service friendly staff keep safe
9229,I feel truly blessed to work for @NHFTNHS. They have been amazing at helping me fit my job around my family without having to step back on what I want to do. This letter just put a smile on a little girls face https://t.co / mNNtmo14Ki

7310,Staff Attitude
7464,Orthopaedics - Poor Care - I went here to have a new plaster put on as I have a fracture in my ankle and there was clear instructions on the system for this a quick look at my ankle no further x-rays taken to be told I'm fine which I clear am not with the excruciating pain I have been in no history taken or listen to.
7528,
9756,Very good care in general very compassionate n supportive staff when it was required
7467,Accident and emergency services - Shocking service - Completely disappointed by A&E department after having to wait over 13 hours in the A&E before being admitted to the hospital for an urgent operation that was later on postponed for two days even though the patient was in extreme pain and unable to move properly.
9848,Helpful staff. Immediate triage. Expected to have to wait longer for doctors assessment. | Follow up after triage and first tests would have been good. I was told to wait in waiting room after tests and was not sure how long I would have to wait to see a doctor. But signs to say to ask if the wait seemed too long. What is too long? Could hear other people being told it could be 4 hours to see a doctor when they went to ask the nurses. But it was not that long actually. 
2042,listened well asked good question very caring and gave reassuring advice overall very helpful
8894,Gynaecology - Brilliant staff - Lovely staff on the Whitehead Women's unit. Really make you feel comfortable and reassured at a worrying time. Ultimate professionals! Thank you so much! 
9827,"Superb care & thankyou - As a nervous patient, first time at Dental Hospital. The dental nurse was very attentive and caring. The dentist explained everything he would be doing and made sure I was happy with it. He made me very at ease as I was very nervous, as did the dental nurse. I wish I could name them as they were marvellous and would highly recommend. Thankyou for helping me and taking my pain away. I wish you so much luck in your future venture as a dentist and thankyou to all staff from going in to leaving. It cant be easy in the current climate and you made everything smooth and reassuring. A big well done and thumbs up from me."
5731,It was a great experience amazing and friendly staff could not fault it perfect care
7629,"I received wonderful care from all the staff, it was so quick - first in and out by 11."
5436,"Terrible service, no communication between A&E services and UTC. Unfortunately I had to visit an Emergency services with my wife who is pregnant. The nursery saw my wife and sent her to go to the UTC (urgent treatment centre). After waiting of around 1 hour and a half we were seen by a GP. First comment was you should not have been sent here but instead to be done a scan. Then we needed to go back to the A&E for a scan where supposedly we don't needed to wait again because the GP was going to right a statement and explain the situation. After going back and forward we had to register again at the main reception wait again for the same process and do the scan that was supposed to be done from the first time."
6500,All great!  Very friendly meeting staff and nurse.
7454,"very busy department last night but the staff did not let that show in their mannerism the people on reception, Tanya, Tammy and a lady who wheeled me through to minors ( I think her name was my kayla and the radiographer all of them were absolutely brilliant and gave the best care despite being so busy thankfully just a severe sprain but Tammy was so thorough thank you all"
7671,"Just attended endoscopy today .fantastic team , well looked after and special mention to Alice Sanders who performed it . She was friendly caring reassuring and gentle . Well done all ...keep up the great work!!! "
7678,"My app was very efficient. Seen in x-ray, consultant and pre-op assessment. Not kept waiting at all and everyone very nice. Thank you all."
839,"Don't know - Amazing service - Visiting the A and E department, treated brilliantly by all the staff we met. Beautifully clean, seen quickly and given full attention, putting our minds at rest. Many thanks "

2040,Expected to wait ages to be seen but this was actually less than 30 minutes. | I didnÔøΩt think the seats in the waiting area were spaced out far enough for COVID.
5051,karma will catch everyone...
7942,Thank you @uhbtrust Had a telephone consultation yesterday and prescription delivered today. That's what I call service.
13,"Came here for some surgery a little while ago, and throughout the whole thing the staff were incredibly professional and caring. They were very receptive to me when I was nervous and everything went smoothly, both pre-op and post-op. I hardly had fun bc it's a hospital i mean come on, but the staff were great and it all went well. The one problem I had was the food, but it's a big place with lots of people to cook for, so what can I say. The wait was also quite long sometimes, but nothing unreasonable for a hospital dealing with so many patients. Yeah if you need some surgery it's a pretty good place to have it."
1291,
5582,nice calm environment lovely staff
2156,
9992,The worst place I've ever been involved with. Was abused and bullied by staff members. Any complaint I tried to make was either ignored or manipulated by management. Would strongly advise anyone to not work for a place like this. I'm currently going through mental health issues because of the way I was treated by these people.
1839,"Arrived at #NGH Sheffield 14.20 ...finally parked 15.15 ...fortunately hubby not elderly or disabled, so dropped him off and continued to drive around until I found a space...Not sure what the answer is? Any suggestions let the powers that be know!! "
2075,The best cardiac hospital in London
7750,Cardiothoracic surgery - Amazing care - From the moment we arrived my daughter was made to feel special and she received the very best care from all the staff on ward 12. They treated her with dignity and couldn't do enough to put her at ease. Regular check were completed with a touch of humour and a smile and communication at every step of the way was faultless. It was great that she had a particular nurse who nurtured her through the whole process and was there to greet her when she came round after her anaesthetic. The surgeon has performed a miracle to fix my daughters heart and all worked beyond duty to put her and us at ease. We can't thank you enough for going above and beyond. 
8677,"Rehabilitation - MILDLY DISAPPOINTED - Overall I could not have wished for better care given to my mother who was a patient on John Proctor Ward. The doctor treating my mother was very professional throughout, as were the auxiliary, staff nurses and occupational therapists. Only doubt I have is whether my mother should have been discharged on Tuesday 11 February to be admitted to a care home as I had been assured that if my mother was too weak to travel she would remain at Lings Bar Hospital. On admission that afternoon to the care home she was extremely weak and the nurse receiving her was that concerned she actually called a doctor to see my mother. She also telephoned me and asked me to attend as soon as possible as my mother was deteriorating rapidly. My mother subsequently passed away Thursday morning 13 February 2020."
564,Don't know - great service - i attended the ultrasound department today and was very happy with my treatment i felt the staff went out of their way to help me . i mentioned to the sonographer that i had another appointment for a week later and asked if it was possible to have my scan while i was there and low and behold it was arranged which i was very grateful for as it saves me having to make another journey next week Well done everyone at Hertford county radiology department

8791,"The doctor on duty took care of me, and did all tests necessary to make sure nothing serious was wrong with me. Staff very friendly, Royal Surrey Hospital Emergency Department best in Surrey. All your good work is apreciate it"
146,Never realy had a problem with the hospital staff ie the nurses or doctors. My issue at this present time is the security staff they have on the doors letting people in they are rude and unhelpful they ask questions regarding why you at the hospital that is none of there business they are just being nosie believing they have the right to know
2375,After 20 years service my wife stood down from @NWAmbulance as a paramedic. HR sent her P45. No compliment slip. No letter of appreciation. Nothing. No empathy at all from Payroll / admin. You should be ashamed. How hard can it be to do the simple things. Not even a card.
9498,Great A&E - I was taken to A&E in a lot of pain and was dealt with very quickly and efficiently by kind and caring staff. The problem was diagnosed after tests and scans and I had an operation in urology department the next day. The staff there were wonderful too. Thank you all so much.
1604,"Thank you to everyone on duty in A&E on the night of 13th. Your kindness, care and professionalism was greatly appreciated. Without you all I might not be here today? I can not thank you all enough my Valentine's Angels."
9524,"Accident and emergency services - Giving thanks - As a mental health support worker I had to attend the hospital with one of my patients who's pneumonia symptom had returned ( she had it in Jan / feb) I would like to thank all the staff from A & E, E M U and Kepple Ward where she now is for their care not only for my patient but for how they have acted towards her supporting staff who must stay with her, not treating us as second class care workers this never happens at Rotherham as it does at other Hospital / Medical services we have to use to care for our ladies. We really cannot thank you enough you are always amazing and at this difficult time you all manage to stay professional, thoughtful and the care you give is second to none . So on behalf of myself and my colleagues at Aspen clinic we thank you from the bottom of our hearts . Stay safe you brave amazing people xx Ann Taylor"
5819,"Excellent children A&E - This is a review and also a thank you to all the doctors, nurses, radiologists, that on the 19th September 2020 took care of my little boy at the Royal Free Hospital -Children A&E.

4236,"General Surgery - Superb Experience - I was admitted to Gilwern Ward as a day case on 17th March 2021. I can honestly say that as soon as I stepped onto the ward my welcome was warm and professional. The ward was relaxed and chilled and ALL staff were attentive, compassionate, respectful and showed dignity. They were extremely friendly and helpful and nothing was too much. ALL the surgical staff too were lovely. They made me feel really relaxed and at ease and again were very attentive. "

I was very nervous and the staff in the unit were at all times professional, kind and empathetic.

A wonderful team thank you! "

8817,"Urgent Treatment Centre - Excellent care - Visited Urgent Care Centre today after a bad fall damaging my leg and ribs. All the staff, receptionists, nurses, doctors radiologists were kind and efficient.

They advised that I go to the hospital as I was experiencing a lot of pain. The service I got was absolutely fantastic and I cannot fault it in any way. I was dealt with quickly politely and expertly by everybody involved. I did not have to wait for any type of service it was all very quick and efficient and I felt that the restrictions around COVID-19 were well observed. The staff were also very friendly and made me feel relaxed. Can you please pass on my heartfelt thanks l, the people at A&E are doing a fantastic job"
6264,"Ophthalmology - Very busy department - Referred to ophthalmology by my optician in December 2019, as she thought I had a possible retinal problem. Appointment 6 weeks later at Eye Hospital. Extremely busy with only one receptionist, no privacy at the desk as the waiting area was pretty full. Nurse instilled eye drops to dilate my pupils, warned this may make me sensitive to light, but whole department is well lit, so unless you've brought sunglasses it's difficult to avoid light. Eyes photographed then waited to see consultant, who spent about 2 minutes telling me no abnormalities. Whole process took 2 hours and cost over 4 to park. Although I received very good news, I felt that this department is chaotic with an expensive car park, and rarely saw a smiling face on the staff / team faces. Hopefully never have to return."

3934,How disgraceful are @broomfieldnhs to leave a potentially high risk mum to be who was waiting for 3 weeks for an appointment for her blood tests and scan then finally gets a letter to say she can't have her maternity care there as fully booked and no referral to an alternative
5286,Good Service - Due to the covid 19 I was unable to go myself and my Daughter took my hearing aids in for me to have new tubes and elbows fitted. They fit perfectly so thank you to your staff for a good job done! 
4091,I have waited over 9 hours to be called back by NHS 111. This is truly unacceptable especially as I was told I needed to be spoken to within 4 hours This is truly unacceptable @NHSEngland @SECAmbulance @MattHancock 9 hours waiting in constant pain and in self isolation!

4931,"Children's & Adolescent Services - Empathetic and supportive nursing staff - We had to stay for 4 nights just before Christmas with our twins. Most of the nursing staff were warm, friendly and knowledgable-willing to help and positive. We are very grateful for their expertise and care. A few areas in need of improvement, an agency nurse for example who didn't know how to make up the Milton sterilising water for bottles whom said she would enquire how to with permanent staff and failed to do so and this had to be chased up some time later when I realised it was not done. This strikes me as very basic and there are instructions clearly written in the milk room about the method but unfortunately parents do not have access to the tablets so rely on staff to help. Another new member of staff, who was very personable / pleasant unfortunately did not seem to be aware as to some of the NHS recommendations around preventing SIDS. The staff member asked whether she could put one of my babies on his front to sleep, a well known risk factor. This is somewhat concerning. All staff should be fully trained and aware of SIDS and the NICE recommendations linked to its preventive measures. Additionally an area which could be improved is communication. We were specifically told by a doctor he would be back to review our babies by the end of his shift so that we knew whether or not we could go home. He gave the impression it was likely we would be going home based on the stats and nurse obs. This was particularly important as we have other young children waiting for us, and it was Christmas Eve. Further we were relying on the goodwill of family to care for them, however, they are elderly and therefore it was no small feat. I had to ask the nurse to find out if this doctor was still on shift. She returned to say he had handed over that we were staying in again but failed to return for the review or even inform us that decision was taken without any further check as was agreed as part of the care pathway. We want the best for our children regardless of the time of year but just would have liked him to be transparent and not give false hope if he believed this wasn't in their best interests. I work for the NHS myself and I make a point of not saying I will do things for clients unless I know that I can or I can delegate so someone else is able to in my absence. The nurse was also unaware of this decision. The nursing staff were very busy due to staff shortage but they all seemed upbeat and willing to spend some time talking with you, which made a big difference to the experience. There were also staff dressed up, decorations and gifts given from santa which was a very kind and thoughtful gesture. Tonbridge angels fc left a gift üéÅ and again this was a heartfelt gesture for unwell children at Christmas time. Also the pharmacy left a gift, again thanks goes to them. I want to thank all the staff involved in the care of our babies, including those who cleaned the room and served food-all were pleasant and helpful. "

3577,"Fall and hurt my Wrist. - I had a rather bad fall at home and attended Louth Urgent Care but I was told because of the nature of my injury I would have to go to Lincoln but I asked to go to Grimsby. What a mistake. I felt unimportant when I was seen. After an X-Ray I was told there was no break, put a splint on &toldto go to my Doctor if no better in a week. I returned to Louth Urgent Care in a lot of pain & no happy with the lack of the treatment &details at Grimsby. It was X-rayed again & a break was found. A different splint put on which was more secure the injury explained which gave me more confidence in their diagnosis. I will not go to Grimsby Hospital again with an injury as I feel that they are not up to the job in hand & need to explain more to the patient. It does not take that much time."

5468,Terrible experience at the breast unit which is uhb managed. All uhb managers agreed it was not good and promised action. The QE was rebuilt in 2010 and numerous refurbs have been done since. And uhb has transformed parts of the old QE- and it's got them lots of glory. Even the fish pond has had attention. But the breast unit has been left stuffed in the women's and left unchanged. And out of uhb executives sight. Off the radar. Absolved responsibility? Surely since the Paterson scandal uhb would want to have the breast unit under its own roof for patient safety? And be quicker to respond to issues? 1 year. No action. Uhb should be ashamed.
4239,Excellent service with motivated staff.
5501,All and i do mean all the staff were so caring and nothing was to much trouble everyone was always smile which made me very at ease i really cant thank everyone for looking after me so well i am sorry but my spelling is so bad because i would say a lot more but all i can say is a very very big thank you to every one

2125,"Rightly so as I had a few symptoms, i was told to wear a facemask but just felt the doctors were very cold toWard me and i didnt feel very human i just felt like a number. I heard 2 nurses say should she be going through there when i was walking to the toilet, but i hadnt been told about what toilet to use (id be put into a seperate corridor for those wearing masks). I just felt lonely and awful. The technical professional care was sublime e.g. fast blood tests etc but just a little lacking on the friendliness, but I appreciate its stressful times."

7838,"20 out of 10 for my experience last week . First in A&E, then assessment unit and finally Nayland ward . I arrived terrified, was calmed and reassured from there on . I always felt like a person and not simply an ailment . From consultants to cleaners, communication and care was exceptional. I was covid tested every time I moved areas ( in case anyone is worried) and hygiene and cleaning were exemplary . It made what could have been a dreadful experience ALMOST pleasant."

9833,"Excellent service - Attended on Saturday at around 10am. Delightful, helpful staff at reception and on the telephone when I rang to check if it was possible just to turn up. The wait was approx 2 hours but worth the wait. The doctor I eventually saw was friendly and thorough and I felt listened to and not rushed even though I know how busy this service must be at the moment. We are lucky to have this centre. "

9259,"Can not thank the staff on ward 1 enough for the care given to our father during his time on this ward. All of the staff are very caring, attentive and nothing was too much trouble for them."
8626,"Service has vanished - While it has been difficult in the past few months to obtain help with replacement of a repeat prescription, I have tried to understand and accept that Covid has impacted their service. But I have now tried to arrange an appointment with a doctor - which took up to 30 minutes of waiting on the phone to arrange. I was told that a doctor would call me sometime between 08h30 and 13h00 on the date they offered. I have still not heard from anybody. It seems to me that this centre no longer provides anything in the way of medical services. Do they even operate anymore? "
7377,"A more dedicated, hard working crew can't be found. #wmas#realeverydayheroes"
5317,"Brilliant - Good advice on the phone in the morning with the offer to come in if not resolved. I rang 111 and my Dr's surgery. Dr didn't ring back by 6.30 as arranged. I understand they must be really snowed under but I needed to see someone. City Care minor injuries centre was the answer. Covid procedures were brilliant. Reception then the nurse rang my mobile. 20 minute wait in the car then asked to the front door. Hand gel, follow me. First class assessment and diagnosis. I am very reassured and grateful. How lucky we are. Thank you to all who help provide these services for us."
309,"Care was reassuring, excellent communication with myself, from nurse and consultant. All tests explained and plan made for further investigation as an outpatient. Extremely positive visit."
8992,"I arrived by ambulance to A & E where I was promptly diagnosed and was on CCU ward within 6 hours. Despite Covid the staff were all in good humour, caring, supportive & professional at all levels. I received excellent life saving care and was discharged after 5 days. I experienced one instance of being advised that a planned procedure might not happen and the reason given was down to lack of knowledge from someone trying to manage my expectations which upset me at the time. Or possibly lack of communication between night and day staff. Also felt consultant could have explained more about situation going"
8870,"Cardiology - amazing care - came in for a routine pacemaker test. within a couple of hours i was whisked off to the day ward and then theatre. During this process and after the procedure, i had nothing but the greatest care and attention. wonderful caring staff. They made something that could of been quite traumatic a very easy and relaxed process. cant thank them enough."

4987,"A&E is such a joke, 5-7 hours waiting times, patients not wearing masks and coughing without covering their mouths, feet with shoes up on chairs, disgusting! Is the staff doing anything about it? nope. triage doctor playing around on his phone, not very professional. If you are not going to do your job, get lost. I came here as they have 3.5 stars, how did that happen? such a joke. Will not come here again."
2882,staff very helpful and friendly
4642,"General Surgery - Staff were marvellous - Went on Saturday am with stomach pains . Had multiple consultations and it was suspected appendicitis. Then had x-rays and ct scan which confirmed it . The clinical care and staff were exemplary. The only issue I had was lack of communication. I wasn't told what was happening next just left waiting. I thought it would be a quick outpatient visit but clearly not . However the first I knew I was staying was when they put a tag on my wrist . Everything else was perfect but it really would help to know what's happening next and when. Thank you to everyone at Pinderfields, ward 34 ward 37 a and e, the surgical staff, cleaners, ward assistants, trainees and nurses, you were all so very, very good"
6932,Don't know - Abusive towards mental health patients - I have been left traumatised after being thrown around and restrained. Cocky comments where made. My chest was exposed. I've been left with bruises all over me. I was promised i'd get help outside of the hospital that hasn't happened it's been over a month. Staff where complaining about mental health patients and gossiping about us while treating us like zoo animals.

2457,"Geriatric Medicine - Excellent follow up and preventative care. - Following successful surgery on a fractured wrist in March, and discharge from the orthopaedic team, I was somewhat surprised to receive an appointment at the Geriatric Medicine Clinic (I'm only 68). However I understood the importance of finding out if I was vulnerable to further fractures due to reduced bone density or other factors. I received a bone density scan, blood tests and answered questions re family history and other possible contributory factors. Happy to report all was well with me, and I didn't require any medications at this time. I think it's very good practice to try and risk assess and prevent future fractures which can impact on a persons lifestyle, and beyond, as well as requiring care from an overstretched NHS. All staff were friendly and helpful. Thank you. "
8183,Being pregnant during COVID19 is stressful but @UHDBTrust your staff are amazing so cheerful even in the most testing of times!! We will certainly be dedicating a clap for you on Thursdays #ClapForOurCarers
9058,"Night staff attitude - It seems like the nights shift down tools and do not do much work. With my own eyes I watched a night nurse observe a man in his 80's drop his chocolate on the floor from his bed to which they just sat there right beside him as he struggled nearly falling off the bed trying to retrieve it. I think because it was dark, they didn't think anyone was watching and just let him struggle. It was only when someone said something that it was picked up and given to him. Shambolic. People's lives are in their hands, and they have a total disregard like that. Along with many more stories I could mention."
5159,"From the minute we arrived we felt safe and secure. The arrangements made by the hospital to limit contact was brilliant.The staff, as per normal, were friendly and guided us through the new process.We were in and out within 30 minutes...could not have asked for more.Well done...the planning and organisation definitely pain off."
3368,Regular phone or video calls with physiotherapist to check on progress and one clinic appointment. Could also ring if I needed to.

1829,In A&E waiting area I witnessed a cleaner wiping the top of a rubbish bin with a cloth that she then went and wiped the top of a water dispenser with. Then she put a pile of cups lid side down in the surface. No antibacterial spray was used. Nursing care and assessment was excellent. Confidentiality is currently non existent in the reception area as you have to shout all details for the staff to be able to hear as masks / shields/ building work are making it so hard to communicate. The whole waiting area can hear exactly where everyone lives and their details.

2324,"Orthopaedics - Breaches of Covid Rules - went for an orthopedic consultation and was only in the centre for 40 minutes. Despite the thoroughness of the lady on the door giving out masks etc I was not pleased to count a receptionist, 3 nurses and a radiologist either not wearing a mask or wearing them round their necks. There was also a fellow patient not wearing a mask properly waiting for her appointment but no one pulled her up on that. But it was the x-ray room that made me most uncomfortable as a confined space and the mask was fully round the neck. I shall not want to come back to the hospital any time soon and as a person who has been shielding i felt very at risk."

I was seen by a very helpful receptionist and waited only a short while for my appointment, but before this a nurse came out to greet me and to tell me the Consultant would be with me shortly. I was seen on time by the Consultant, who listened to my problems and we discussed the way forward, starting with bloods. She was fantastic. I then went to Haematology, where I was also seen promptly. All in all, an excellent service from everyone at K&C - I cannot praise them enough for their efficiency and care. "

8401,"Children's & Adolescent Services - Thank you - My son over the last twelve months has been admitted a few times due to his health. He has open access. From the initial phone call to discuss admission to discharge his care has been outstanding. My son has Learning disabilities and has anxiety surrounding the hospital; which is totally understandable. As a result he can be a little bit of a pickle and not the easiest patient. The nurses were patient, kind and understanding. As were the Doctor's and they listened to my husband and myself. Our questions were answered and we felt reassured. The staff are clearly very busy despite that the care he received was superb. For that we are truly grateful to all of the staff on Polkerris. Thank you."
1584,I had excellent care by all staff who were extremely kind and friendly when I attended A & E on Wednesday night 14th July.

Truly gratefulüôè
8930,Nice building and staff - Staff and facilities are pleasant. Only negative is the lack of signage. The Shropshire Orthopaedic Outreach Service (SOOS) is not on this website as a service that runs at this location. There are various others that are also not listed.
1966,Only had to wait about 30 minutes. The Doctor was lovely and very thorough. Only concern is paying for parking!
2571,"The service I have had in the 3 hospitals, I have been to recently has been fantastic. No need to improve. Thank you"
8871,"Dermatology - Fantastic service - After being referred by my GP with an infected spot on my ear I was somewhat aprehensive when I attended the Dermatology Department at RBH. The Consultant and team were such professional with patient care at the heart of everything they did. I was put at ease, given the information I required and booked in for a minor procedure to remove the spot and undertake a biopsy. The team assured me that no matter what treatment was effective. Three days later I attended again and the team put me at ease as a shave biopsy was undertaken. Thankfully a very small non-life threatening cancer was diagnosed and I was referred to the Plastics Department to tidy up my scar. I can't thank the Consultant and the Dermatology Team enough for such kindness in what was a most stressful situation, especially when they were so obviously under the strain and trying to catch up after lockdown had been eased. Platinum service! "
6518,Worst doctors surgery members of staff lie and joke about patients doctors don't care wate of time called 111 who said needed a call back urgently they don't bother gone to NHS UK about the surgery everybody needs to complain to NHS UK then this surgery will have to change
4785,"Fab Paramedics!! üòä - I would just like to say a huge thank you to the two fab paramedics from Exeter Hospital who came to me today! I had an appointment at the doctors surgery and the nurse phoned 999 as my blood pressure and heart rate were a bit too high. The paramedics came really quickly and were so reassuring, friendly and made me feel so much calmer, we also had a giggle too which really helped me feel better about the situation! I didn't need to go to hospital after all but I had to pick up a prescription. They drove to the pharmacy and even went in and collected it for me as I couldn't collect it due to a Covid19 test earlier that day. They then gave me a lift home, I said I could walk but they said as it was cold it might make my asthma worse. They were just brilliant and I can't thank them enough!! xx"

2827,Geriatric Medicine - Great care - Many thanks to the staff on Newquay Hospital ward who looked after one of my friends. Excellent care and support given to him and his family during a very sad time. 
6999,"Felt cared for. - Submitted with infection - did initially go from A&E to several departments and underwent every procedure possible - id dread to think of the bill if i went private or was in as USA hospital! - spent 7 nights in Telford Princess Royal Hospital. I'd heard of previous reports about the hospital.. but as I was in so much pain when submitted that kind of goes out of your head. However, although I was wheeled through several wards during my stay, as each one tried to find out my cause and solutions, I never at one moment felt uncared for. I saw limitations that were put on staff and where fault and blame could be pointed. Who is perfect? At NO point did I feel that I was actually neglected through someones choice. We all like response when WE choose it. We don't like in such a perfect world. I actually would wonder how those who complain NHS are not at their side on their whim would fair in a private hospital? Maybe free TV gives them distraction? In short. I went into the Princess Royal listening, reading and believing all those reviews.. and reports... I came out the other end at an opposite end of the scale. They work hard. There are soo many demands. They deal with people that I dont want to describe here because I just cant get my head around how they react. They deal with human imperfection that the MAJORITY would reject from having to deal with. I left Telford Princess Royal humbled. I did the obvious... I made sure chocolates were left at every ward i attended. thats just recognition. If I had a magic wand, I'd give the Princess Royal... "

4539,"Update:. My HGC has now raised to 595!!! . Recently found out I was pregnant on Tuesday, I go to the hospital with abnormal pain, spotting which I was not concerned about (3rd baby) and I had this with both my children. I then have to wait 4 hours in pain for my bloods to be taken and then just to be told we have booked you in for a scan the following day. I turn up at my scan only to be told I've ‚Äúmiscarriage‚Äù because my ‚Äúuterus was empty and my HGC was 30‚Äù I said could it be a... case where I'm early in the pregnancy and the doctor goes ‚Äúit's unlikely‚Äù he then sends me on my way, in tears, crying for 2 days. I finally had enough I then go on to ring my personal doctors, she is shocked from my notes as I've been up there 3/4 times, I explain I've been up there and I've been told to ‚Äúwing‚Äù it another week and ring back if I still have a positive pregnant test in a weeks time. She then goes on to ring the hospital and demand I get seen. I arrive back up the hospital for the fourth time, and get seen by a lovely midwife, she checks my cervix, and it was closed and high up all good signs, she then takes my blood, 3 hours later she then comes and finds me and tells me my HGC is now 96 which has tripled to what it originally was. I go for a scan 30 minutes after, and there on the screen you can see a small small sac. So tomorrow I have to return for more blood & have another internal Friday, I have lost the piece off paper with this doctors name, but he will be in the department where I have to go tomorrow & will then add his name to my review. . It's still early days but at the moment it's looking more positive & no sign off a miscarriage, my HGC is rising, and will add tomorrow if it has risen again. . But I am disgusted he just assumed I have all because I was to early & my HGC was 30. A complain is in the making."

Honestly, I would not let them operate me there, you will feel at untrusted hands and also unprofessionally cared. After being registered at other times it has never appended to me."

880,"Neurology - Fantastic Staff- A True Credit To The NHS - A week in a single room in the Murray Faulkner Ward actually trying to have the seizures which leave a hideous hangover for several days afterwards could have been a nightmare of boredom and depression! I cannot thank the team enough for the excellent service which they give; without exception kind, compassionate, understanding and extremely positive with the whole seeming well organised and managed. At many times staying on the ward was more similar to staying in a hotel than in a hospital and on those grounds I can only complain that the mattress was a little soft! Staff working long shifts do not seem to let it affect them, frequent checks on wellbeing inspire confidence that no seizure would be missed. I am under no false illusion that the many of patients on the ward probably needed much more intensive care and attention than me but they also seemed, from as far as I could see, to be getting it. Frequent ward rounds by doctors and nursing staff each clearly explaining what had to be said made me feel well informed and that everyone was fully aware of patient needs. It would be easy to focus just on nursing and medical staff but it obviously takes more than just them to maintain a well managed ward. Cleaning and general housekeeping staff seem to have the same mentality; always polite and almost offended when I tried to help. All in all, what could have been a hidious experience was almost enjoyable and I have every confidence that this is the norm on the ward. Please make sure that everyone in the team receives full credit and commendation for their efforts you are an exceptional credit to the NHS. Thankyou Chris G"

8426,"I have been passed from doctor to consultant for unknown condition for nearly 2 years. Finally I was referred to the rehabilitation clinic! What can I say. Dr Kim was so patient, thorough and kind. She explained everything to me so that I could understand it. Even symptoms I dismissed as normal she went through with me. I know exactly what is wrong with me now and whilst I wait to see the therapist I've already started trying to help myself and I think it's working. Thank you so much for being such an amazing doctor! "

8552,"After ringing 111 Today (Bank Holiday Monday) they advised I attended A&E immediately with my 3 year old daughter. We checked in and the staff were so helpful & friendly. We then got sent through to the Children's A&E department & got seen by a lady called ‚ÄòLee' - who then placed us in our own room awaiting further checks. We then had another lady ‚ÄòPERSON' & and doctor ‚ÄòPERSON' who tended to us throughout Isla's stay within the Children's A&E department - and all 3 were absolute...ly outstanding! ‚ÄòPERSON' came into us various times and every single time she was so interactive with Isla, went to Isla's level, in turn Isla became happily cooperative with what was necessary, even though she was anxious & unsure of what was being done. Dr ‚ÄòPERSON' was the same, talkative & interactive that again - Isla's trust was gained & necessary care received. These Nurses & Doctors today we're absolutely amazing! They adapted completely to Isla's age & needs and done so remarkably! Thank you so so much, for all your time & efforts today - you really did work wonders & made a very sick 3 year old happy still.... Amazing! Thank you. (P.S. I really do PERSON I got the Nurses & Doctors name correct - apologies in advance if I haven't). X"

Having been bitten by a rat I presented at A & E as it was then. When the triage nurse asked me what had happened I explained I had been bitten by a rat. Her next question was - 'was it dead?

9416,Great care with fantastic staff.
2261,"Appalling practice - When we joined this practice it was a pretty good service. There were no issues getting appointments and friendly, helpful receptionists. My word has it changed. It is now near impossible to book an appointment, you are routinely told to come and sit for hours in the 'walk-in' clinic instead. They don't seem to get the idea that for routine appointments and medication reviews that is neither appropriate, nor convenient for working people. The latest receptionist seems to think that every patient is there simply to waste his precious time. He is routinely rude and obstructive to the needs of patients. On the positive side if you do eventually get past the front staff, the clinicians are almost all very good. Unfortunately, the rigmarole of trying to actually get to see the clinicians makes this surgery a no go for me. We are looking to change ASAP."

The speed and efficiency with which the team dealt with me was fantastic. From the collection by the wonderful ambulance crew right through to the coronary care unit was one fantastic medical journey. I cannot praise the team highly enough, only to say I will never have feelings of trepidation if I am unfortunate to have to make the same journey. A very well rehearsed team, a big thankyou to everyone! "

6856,"Today I received an email to say an appointment had with neurology which is important had cancelled despite when booking it being told needed to be seen face to face by my consultant Dr Lindert the gentleman booking the appointment at that time was amazing & said if I was ok to come to Sheffield it would be 25th October so you make arrangements etc. Today it's the 6th December, I proceeded to call neuroscience an to say the last was met with the obnoxious call handler where the only answer was ‚Äòthe computer says no', I asked if she would speak with my consultants secretary and her manager got put on hold an again ‚ÄòNO', I asked to make a complaint an expressed to speak with her manager an again ‚Äòno you need to take this number, which I declined it was pals I called back switchboard as I had no pen to hand. The lady within pals went through my concerns and said let's log initially as an informal complaint because formal takes 50 days to answer by then she said the appointment would have happened, a bit of honest which was great an inspired me with confidence. I was told she would send an email to the service manager thus was 15:30 if I hadn't heard anything by early next week call p as to chase. Again managed expectations an showed willing to help an felt it would hopefully be resolved. By 16:39 Mike the service manager called absolutely spot on down to earth guy listened and got how I was feeling, my concerns but also I'm known to the department an hospital due to ongoing advanced health issues. Mike was very apologetic and asked if I could make an appointment with the consultant on the 20th Oct instead which I was so great ful for, he also checked I was aware of my other appointments that week an they were still ok really going the extra mile and reassurance with anything in the futurewotj. Just goes to show how two people working together to listen an help. An yes they may not have been able to get me an earlier appointment but it s the actions of going the extra mile and willing to st least try an help that sticks me. Very great ful from bott of my heart, I hope the original call hss as boxer can reflect on Their actions but more importantly Mike and the lovely lady from pals get to see this / their managers / the trust and recognition is given. Dr Lindert, Julie the Botox nurses, the nurses on Neuro outpatients and L floor neurology inpatient are all amazing I appreciate everything you do for me Love Gemma B xxx"

I went into labour last week and having been told my local hospital's maternity ward at Peterborough was closed we were told to go to Hinchingbrooke. As soon as I stepped through the front doors we were greeted with kind and caring staff. The gentleman on reception fetched me a wheelchair and took me to the maternity ward. Every single member of staff was incredible. They helped me through a difficult lab...our which ended up with me in theatre and throughout I could not have felt more safe and looked after by them all. I wish I could remember all of their names. I was constantly checked on, given so much help and advice and I am truly grateful for them being there for me.

89,"A&E I expected to be bad but not that bad! In the middle of the week it was like Bedlam from the time I got there at 6 till the time I decided for my health I had to leave as the sun started to rise. It took 9 hours to see the medics team post blood test results having been told it would take a few hours as i was being looked after by the medic team. It took another 2 hours to try and get me a bed after being asked by the medics to stay over night). Suddenly I was told to go to a room with people crammed in on drips that noone had mentioned. In fact noone told me what was going on ever the whole 11 hours I was there. I was even sent to the wrong department for an hour and a half that was my fault apparently. The care shown to patients was next to none existant. You need to brave to be old for sure! One old lader was left slumped over a chair for 10 hours a lot of the time looking scared and in pain. Someone finally realised she needed attention and suggested to someone to get her a hot cup of tea which was out in her hand as she was semi conscious. It nearly scolded her but other patients saw this was wrong and ran to take it off her. She was shoved a sandwich that she would never have even been able to open if she was fully conscious. Noone offered water in A&E until I started getting dizzy again. I had not eaten or slept for 48 hours so would have been nice to be told what was going on as I sat right next to people violently throwing up and shouting in pain wishing only to be somewhere else not surrounded by people trying not to pretend they were somewhere else. Nurses seemed only hostile in their manner to people, obviously warn out and stressed. One nurse seemed so stressed she was shouting names in people's faces to find the right person. One staff member who signed off medication just seemingly disappeared although the fact the nurses had been calling them a different name all evening didn't help to find sed staff member. The whole place had the feeling of being in an apocalyptic limbo land where noone gives a care about anyone it's just a stressful job to try to get through till staff can get home. I'm not blaming staff there is clearly no organisation or care left in the NHS under such pressure. Sympathy to the elderly and those needing morphine would atleast be nice. I'm sure by no means was that worst night but that A&E building is brand new! Who designed it to feel like a prison. The relief to find a seat at last next to a wall so I could rest my head was a reflect of my night Anyone who sits there will spend a long time feeling worse before they get better! "

3004,am sorry guys am sick and tired of everything and your service
5747,"I was recently here for a CVS test in the fetal medicine unit and couldn't be happier with the care they gave me. After my local hospitals couldn't get me booked in for weeks, John Radcliffe booked me in for the next day. The consultant and nurses were fantastic, they explained everything so well, and continued to look after me after the test (close to fainting!). They even gave me the results the next day, when its usually 2-3 working days. I owe them all a massive thank you - I only wish this was my local hospital! "
405,"As per usual, the Whitworth Urgent treatment centre gave fantastic care to my son. Fast, friendly, patient centred and caring. Thank you for looking after my family-again üòÇü•∞üëç @DCHStrust @TracyAllenDCHS @MIUMatron"

1509,"Staff was very polite, helpful and quick. They really knew their job and I felt protected and supported. The only negative i observed was that even though the senior Dr. assisted a very old lady when she entered the treatment room, he did not help her when the appt finished. Maybe it s not part of the job, but helping afterthe appt finished shows empathy and real care"

7931,Thank you to the staff on day surgery today @SalfordRoyalNHS including the student nurse from @SalfordUni for taking good care of my mum whilst having spinal surgery @SrftPef @ktefoster @tyroneroberts2
9581,Attended here for several different reasons. Xray department were excellent. Appointment at 10am out at 10.10am üëèüëç
5252,"Was very quick and pleasant. The nurse who I saw was absolutely lovely, very friendly very caring and just lovely!"
8915,"Amazing staff - I was called back after a routine breast screen showed something that needed further investigation. I ended up having a biopsy and a vacuum biopsy. From the routine biopsy to the final diagnosis the staff couldn't have been better. Every single member of staff helped me relax through the unpleasant and uncomfortable experience. I can't thank them enough for their kind care, keeping me fully informed and chatting to keep my mind off of the procedure. In the waiting room there was a poster of how to complain, this annoyed me because there was no poster of where to praise and thank the wonderful staff. I have had the same wonderful care in every department I have ever been treated. "
1142,"The excellent Service in Gynae Clinic on 1B - Went to have a coil fitted and the team were absolutely brilliant. Put me at ease and nothing was too much trouble. All the staff were friendly and I felt that they really knew how I felt and what they needed to do to make the experience as good as it could in the circumstances. Everything was fully explained before, during and after - including being given literature to take away. "
5695,"Very intimidating to be confronted by a panel of 4-5 people when you attend an appointment on your own. It would be helpful if people introduced themselves. They laughed at me when I said my brain tumour is exactly where I used to hold my mobile phone. Was told 18 months ago my case would be discussed at a management meeting with a view to treatment, this gave me (false) hope‚Äì but it never came up again. Consultants would do well to understand the impact of creating false hope. I took the initiative and asked for a low-cost non-invasive treatment and was told no ‚Äì without a substantive reason. My request and the denial were omitted from my medical record. Consultant claimed I was anxious in his report after I described my first seizure, a pretty terrifying experience. Yet he provided no evidence to support his claim and I have no history of anxiety. He claimed I had not experienced a seizure despite not witnessing it. I have been warned I am at risk of seizures. I've been waiting almost a year for them to deal with my complaint and my care has been undermined as a result; I'm supposed to be seen every 6 months but have not been seen for almost a year. They also breached the GDPR after promising me 2 x in writing they would adhere to the law."
4746,Great care shown and all tests needed were done. Reason for not being a higher score was the waiting time.... it took 6 hours.
3258,"1st ever telephone outpatient appointment with @dralisonbedlow (experienced, professional and lovely Consultant) at @nhsswft. For me, personally, this has been a positive development (no travel time, car parking or waiting time). Thanks for offering this service. #swft #nhs"
9022,"Moved my care to Royal Stoke as I wasn't happy with my previous provider missing scan & screening windows. Particularly as I was classed as high risk due to reoccurring miscarriage. As soon as I changed service providers the care was worlds apart. Staff were informative, friendly and actually behaved like they cared. When I went in for my c-section all staff were welcoming, thorough and reassuring. They talked through every step of what to expect and what they were doing. ... After care team back on 206 staff were so helpful and tentative. I was struggling breast feeding, but staff were so supportive helping to express colostrum and showing me different techniques. There was no rushing to leave me to it. Eventually after a few hours of trying to breastfeed I had to concede and move onto bottle feeding. There was no judgement, just more support. Overall so pleased with how everything went and how professional and supportive all staff were. The only negative thing I have to say is regarding the new cots for next to the bed. Not sure who thought the design would help, even some of the staff were perplexed. The cots are nice and see through to see baby. Quite deep and they don't drop low enough to be able to access them easily from bed should you have a wound, as I did. That made it quite difficult to put baby in and out of the cot without having to raise the bed to almost full capacity."
6104,"Discussion on #medicaltraining reminded me of one my trainers (Victor Parsons, @KingsCollegeNHS) who taught me value of only doing blood tests when it makes a difference (no routine tests!) & always try to guess the results as it will help hone your overall diagnostic skills."
153,Thank you to the nurses at @RBNHSFT who cared for me whilst recovering from a procedure in 2016 And to the nurses at @UHP_NHS who cared for me during my inpatient stay last August when I was ill with e.Coli. #InternationalNursesDay2020 #IND2020

3220,Had a stomach operation 3 years ago. Was offered oramorph in recovery but didn't feel too bad so refused it. Recovery nurse said she will tell them on the ward I haven't had pain relief and advise to give me some when needed. Later that night I was in agony but told there was no doctor available to sign for pain relief for me. A few weeks later I spoke to my consultant who assured me there is always a doctor on call but also said they have had this problem before! Hence I will NEVER have another operation in that place.
9462,1 very good | I found everyone helpful and explaining the time of waiting was spot on when I was seen
6504,"doctors, assistance, and helpers are wonderful memories."
1633,Staff Attitude 
6151,"Accident and emergency services - A & E - Staff did what they could when I was recently admitted with a serious head injury. They deserve credit in the current pandemic period where the provision of PPE was not all that it could have been (whether government or departmental management is at fault here, I don't know). That said, I was unhappy with a somewhat crass and personalised remark one staff member made about my appearance. I will not divulge any names here but would suggest circulation of some sort of memorandum reminding staff that tactless and unprofessional remarks towards patients are not acceptable. Furthermore, during the 9 hours I spent in A&E I was not offered a hot drink at any point. I was offered a fish sandwich but that was because I was given a medication (ibuprofen) which could have upset my stomach without food intake. I had a squashed packet of crisps in my pocket and made to with that but offering a fish sandwich to a patient where the department appeared to have no policies whatever on special dietary needs (I am a vegetarian) is surely not acceptable. Indeed, I find it quite staggering in the third decade of the twenty-first century that your department has a mindset on this question which appears to be mired in the 1950s... I was also very unhappy with the fact the A&E department had no provision to ensure a discharged patient with a serious head injury was taken home in an ambulance or similar hospital car. I was required to make my own way home at my own expense in a taxi where the department gave out completely wrong information about which taxi firms would accept debit cards. I received a text message asking me to comment on my experiences in the hospital but the only number given in said text would allow me to reply... Thank you to hard-pressed hospital staff on the front line but, given the above, there is surely a lot that needs looking into. "
8591,"Gastrointestinal and Liver services - Staff were really wonderful - Only complaint is really the communications. I received letters between 1 and 2 weeks after they were written. 1) I was therefore informed on the afternoon preceeding my procedure, that I'm supposed to stop using a certain medicine 2 weeks before my procedure. 2) I was invited to make an appointment for the procedure within 2 weeks if receiving the letter. Upon calling, I discovered that 2 weeks have already passed and I was off the system and had to start again from scratch. Luckilyxtge team leader agreed to reinstate my file and an appointment was arranged for soon after. Dates on letters seem to suggest a problem with dispatch to the post. Might not always end well. Overall, very happy. "
4260,STOP
3434,"The ladies a and e toilet was overflowing with poo amd when I complained nothing was done. I went back and checked half hour later amd still the same. Then a nurse came out literally screaming at me and said oh you waited half an hour? Sarcastically. Then said if I don't go away she will call the police. My mother (with dementia) was there after the emergency ambulance took her to hospital in pain, she was dumped in the main waiting area and ignored- no checking nothing. and I was so upset I had to leave her there alone and ask my siblings to come and look after mum. Disgusting staff. Disgusting hospital"

As a type 2 diabetic the poor quality bread and jam or marmalade wasnt good either, was very surprised that a hospital didnt provide low sugar jam at least or and egg option .The beef curry was served looking like a picture of a moon crater!

967,Environment 
6534,"Accident and emergency services - Wonderful professional care. - I was admitted to A&E via ambulance after experiencing severe vertigo, headache and vomiting and my condition was deteriorating. Not knowing what was happening to me and believing I may be suffering the symptoms of a stroke, I was immediately taken to a cubicle in A&E. Intravenous Lines were fitted, after I was stabilised with Oxygen. Anti nausea medication was administered which, within a few minutes reduced the nausea. Over the course of my stay, being 7 hours, blood tests were carried out, my oxygen levels, heart rate (ECG) and blood pressure were constantly monitored and I was sent to the CAT Scan department for a brain scan. Thankfully, after testing me for a potential stroke using specific physical tests, no evidence of stroke was detected. Throughout my stay in A&E, the whole department who looked after me, from the Consultant, the doctor, the nurses and porters were completely professional and caring, not only with in administering their medical expertise but also in their caring manner which, during a very worrying time for me, was as important. At a difficult and demanding time for the NHS, these professionals stayed cool, calm and collected. All who aided me in my recovery, in A&E, are not only a credit to the NHS but also to themselves. Well done and thank you again."
5271,"After 3 hours spent waiting, got a wrong diagnosis. As if the doctor didn't even listen what I said, or is just purely incompetent. Total waste of time, and health. Never again, I hope it's just 1 doctor, not every one."
1212,"I was admitted due to a blood clot, at 37 weeks in my pregnancy. The care from the emergency team and the midwifery team was above & beyond. Thank you for everything! "
236,"Time for all NHS staff to ask themselves what side of history they wish to be on? Because when the Nuremberg trials 2.0 begin, once again, following orders will not be a sufficient excuse."
9493,"I would like to thank Dr Luther and all the staff in the catheter lab for looking after me during my cardiac ablation procedure. I would also like to thank all the staff on Holly Suite for their reassurance, excellent care and professionalism shown throughout. The care delivered from outpatients to discharge has been exceptional. You truly are amazing. Thanks again Stephen Holleran."
4579,"my son and I - My son was living at home with his brother and I until recently but because of some of his behaviours we had been finding it hard to manage at times. He was going to a day centre, but it had to stop going because of his behaviour there as well. The staff at ICATT helped with things like getting into respite care which lead to a long-term placement for him. It has helped so much so we can concentrate on us. I was in hospital myself for a little while and the ICATT kept on working with my other son. Nice people brill team."
1583,Star rating minus 5. How the hell can the GP access a physical problem without seeing the parent. Yet community nurses are expected to see patients to collect a urine sample! GP wage should now be reflected on the number of face-to-face INTERACTIONS. They'd want to see patients then! Now let's see how long it takes for the GP to call and assess me over the phone. The call is now 20 minutes late and counting.
451,Just visited leigh infirmary urology outpatient department and I can honestly say the treatment I received from the two nurses was excellent. Thank you

1619,
1041,The waiting times for collecting a prescription are abysmal!! Being sick and making you wait for so long feels sooo wrong. Be prepared if you want to collect a prescription at the hospital pharmacy as they are super slow. It took me 15mins to get a token and more than 1 hour from then to just collect two medicines. Wish they worked more efficiently.
8244,"Respiratory Medicine - Great staff and hospital - Over the past 10 weeks my wife has been admitted to Hinchingbroke on a number of occasions and has spent time in Walnut and finally Peartree Ward, before being transferred to St Johns Hospice. The treatment she received from all the staff was exemplary. It would be unfair to pick out one individual as being better than others, as they were all brilliant. Thankyou all so very much for your help and kindness in what is a very difficult time."
4501,"Cardiology - Great service - Attended for an ECG today. Had been shielding for many months, and was very anxious about attending. Young lady put me completely at ease, spoke to me calmly, and was very friendly and professional. First class service. Also social distancing was completely maintained within the hospital, with one way in and one out of the place. Signage everywhere to keep left, and one way arrows. Well done County Hospital. "
8370,My son went to pathology at hemel hospital today. He was very nervous but was reassured by a kind and considerate phlebotomist. He doesn't know her name but was very grateful. Thank you @WestHertsNHS

8265,8 hours waiting time for emergency services? Abysmal.
3400,Accident and emergency services - Great Care- Thank You. - I wanted to find an appropriate channel to thank you sincerely for the care my family member received in A&E. He was given good care throughout the entire pathway from incident to discharge and was assessed promptly and thoroughly. We were given good follow up advice and are incredibly grateful for the work of the NHS. Thank you. 
9532,"All points of contact were exemplary, from being screened, booking in, seeing a nurse and finally the doctor. All were efficient, polite and friendlyAlso having witnessed your staff being abused by a less than intelligent spud-faced gammon, I appreciate their job is made harder by the less socially acceptable British public"
8521,Prayed to God I would die and now my dads in the hospital with heart issues... worst possible irony
7844,"Urgent Treatment Centre - Terrific service and care - i went to Buxton urgent treatment centre the other day to check on some dressing a couple of weeks after a hernia operation. perhaps I was fortunate that the centre was not as busy as usual, but the service, care and attention I received was fabulous. Everyone - from reception to treatment - did a really good job. The nurse who treated me was also being shadowed by a first year nursing student, so I managed to get a running commentary of what she was doing, and why. Save our NHS!! "
1165,Went to the minor injuries and illness unit and the staff were honestly the most helpful and lovely people; a real credit to the NHS The hospital was very clean and tidy too!

4423,I had my op at the Nuffield. Clean and well equipped room. Excellent nursing and very good all round experience
5973,Communication between staff regarding treatment is very poor leading to frustration and long wait times. The staff is very thoughtful and caring but let down by the administration.
5375,"Very Good doctors and nurses . This is the most professional hospital I've ever visited but ... Security is rude, unprofessional and some of them don't speak English . I understand that security is not accustomed to treat people same way like the NHS staff but at the end of the day they should . I was there with my partner who has difficulty walking and was having MRI Scan . I wasn't able to wait for her due to Coronavirus restrictions which is understandable so decided to go to the food court only to be told in broken English that I need to leave hospital using main door . When asked where can I wait for my partner I was told outside . It was December in the morning so you can imagine weather outside ."

8470,"Day treatment services - Fantastic service - Following a CT scan to check kidney following partial nephrectomy, I was referred to the Breast Clinic by the Urologist, my appointment was just 2 weeks later.

7795,I delivered my baby girl in the pool room on delivery on March 17th and my experience and the care I received were second to none. My wonderful midwife Izzy was simply amazing and made me feel listened to and comfortable the whole time. I was so happy I got to deliver while she was on shift! 
6341,"Diagnostic Endoscopy - Fantastic team - Visited yesterday for investigation. The team who attended to me in the endoscopy suite were wonderful. I was quite anxious about the procedure but they explained everything and were so patient and kind and gentle and professional, I was completely as ease when the procedure began. What amazing staff you have at Whiston Hospital. "

5518,Reception staff very friendly with a goodbye when I left.Man who did my procedure was very pleasant and explained the process and the findings very effectively.
7670,"Accident and emergency services - VERY DISAPPOINTING - My mother was taken to A & E this morning around 10 am and my husband and I went to see her whilst she was still there at about 2 pm. We asked a man sitting behind a computer as to who we could speak to about my mother. He pointed to a nurse dressed in blue, we asked him for her name and he said he didnt know (very odd that he would be working with someone but didnt know her name). We then asked the nurse for an update on my mother and the reaction from her was as if we were troubling her. We had to continue asking her questions, she wasnt forthcoming and her and we really felt we were being a nuisance. When we saw my mother she was soaking wet with urine and once again I approached the same nurse who said my mother was shortly being transferred to another dept. I insisted that she be changed and 2 lovely smiling assistants came and changed her. Once mum was transferred to Bay F it was totally different. The nurse / sister there couldnt have been more personable and helpful although she and her care assistant were totally rushed off their feet. We were treated like human beings - Thank you "

2901,to get someone to answer the phone is almost impossible. I suggest they either get more staff or phones or get them to take shorter tea / coffee / toilet breaks. the telephone service is abysmal.

3469,"General Surgery - So impressed with the staff on Ward 14 and in A & E - Having been through a horrific ordeal at a Leeds hospital over the weekend, I went to York A&E on the recommendation of my supervisor. What a difference in care and professionalism. Everyone from the A&E staff to the staff on the surgical assessment unit to the staff in Ward 14, to the theatre staff, were all absolutely lovely. I was seen, assessed and treated with dignity and kindness. Having worked myself throughout the pandemic in health and social care, I am very familiar with the sort of treatment I have a right to expect, and the staff at York Hospital exceeded those expectations in magnificent fashion. What a lovely bunch, I simply can't thank them enough. They are all a credit to the NHS and, in my opinion, what the NHS is all about. Thank you all for fixing me. You're bloody magic! HAPPY"
2034,"Refuses to respond to formal written complaints - As someone who doesn't have long to live, I find the disrespect and downright hostility with which King's treats aggrieved patients very sad indeed. Based on the behaviour witnessed, my perception is that staff derive gratification from ignoring letters sent special delivery as a way of snubbing patients. I find it unacceptable ‚Äì even for an unprofessional entity such as the NHS ‚Äì to refuse to respond to formal written complaints repeatedly. No company would get away with this, but when it's the nhs there is absolutely nothing you can do and they know it. I really cannot express how distressing I have found King's continued refusal to respond to a very simple complaint over 6 months. King's is an utter disgrace to the profession. In time, perhaps in later life, you may come to realise how much harm your behavior causes to people like me and to yourselves. I will pray for you. "
4669,"The quality of professionalism here at Eastbourne District General Hospital, care and compassion at every level of my treatment from admissions to discharge, is the best in the world. The reason I am alive today is because of this hospital and the people in it. They are incredibly overworked yet provide a superb service. I feel privileged and profoundly grateful to have been treated here."
8966,Northwick park expects sick patients to drive all the way back to collect there medication. Because pharmacy is too busy to give them to you. Disgraceful NHS
2895,i would recommend the ambulance service usually they are all brilliant. except for last night after a paramedic failed to book my 8 month old prem baby in after she had rolled off our bed and banged her head. we was left sat in the waiting area for hours and nobody even knew we was there because they didnt do the handover! when i confronted doctors at the hospital why i was still sat waiting after numerous children was in and out being seen my daughter had no obs done or any...thing the whole time we were there waiting because they were all completely unaware we was there and had to retake our details... not to mention the paramedic was falling asleep in the back of the ambulance on the way to the hospital.... all paramedics do an amazing job but last night couldve easily been avoided if anything wouldve happened to my daughter those paramedics wouldve been held responsible!

Staff were amazing and at a time when we could not visit him to keep his moral up and support him, the staff certainly did this. They were exceptional in their care and understanding and worked under difficult times during Covid 19. Thank you for the love and care, x"

6292,I would give it more than that ther services and care was shocking to say the least. Worst hospital ever!! | The worst hospital I have ever had the misfortune to be in. After a collision on my motorcycle I was taken to A&E left for hours not knowing what was going on then told I would need a head and chest X-ray. Waited again for hours with no visit from any doctor before being moved to another room eventually given head CT scan and told all was ok. When I questioned the non existent X-ray nobody really knew what was going on despite me being placed on a board awaiting the X-ray it was never carried out. Eventually after a staggering 8 hours since being admitted a doctor did a 2 minute examination of me and sai
6061,"Accident and emergency services - Great care - I was admitted after a bike accident, I don't remember much as I have a concussion, but I would just like to say a very big thank you to all staff for treating me. I understand I was a bit uncooperative, which I must apologise for . The staff do an amazing job . Thank you for looking after me "
7402,"I had the #COVIDVaccination earlier today at the @royalmarsdenNHS as a staff member. So far so good, thank you @royalmarsdenNHS."
1735,"Ophthalmology - Amazing care and caring staff - Where to begin I first visited the eye centre in January 2021 as the next Covid lockdown began again... The eye clinic department was Covid safe and staff were available to help. My appointment was with an Oculoplastics consultant. I was apprehensive about my appointment as I was fully aware that investigative surgery was required. The consultant and her team made me feel very confident that they knew the best course of treatment. I agreed to surgery that would happen soon. Then Covid restrictions meant a longer wait. I wish to thank the staff in the office in the background that keep everything ticking over, they were always happy to answer questions and reassure that everything was on track. Then fast forward to April 2021 get the call surgery is going to happen, from that moment forward I can honestly say although still very apprehensive all nursing staff from pre-assessment to Covid swab were happy to answer any questions . Then the day you walk on the ward and it's happening Looking back and reflecting I was in very safe hands. The ward staff of ward 20 were so kind and made sure that I was safe and well cared for. The staff in the theatre need a thanks too! And the recovery room. As each and every one that took care of me made sure that I was their number one priority even though there was other patients to care for. Nothing was too much bother even when I was unwell after surgery. So again a HUGE thank you. I am well on the way to recovery and a a new normal life. as my son said eyes are not everyone's thing but so grateful that the eye department make it their thing. Eyes and their care are like marmite not everyone's choice but grateful that Oculoplastics team do what they do!!! "
9272,"Ophthalmology - visit to emergency eye clinic. - Treated very well. Staff all very friendly and caring. Satisfied that my problem was sorted and advice given. On the negative side I was not followed up by my local eye specialists until I enquired myself and found that they knew nothing about me! That was disappointing as I have now to begin from scratch again with diagnoses and treatments. GP received instructions to carry on with the eye drops, but no other information regarding my condition."

They are doing everything to help and support her and also are incredibly caring and thoughtful to us as her family. They provide daily updates and explain clearly what is happening as well as making it possible for us to communicate with my mum despite her condition. It's so much better than we dared hope for and to know that she's in the very best hands is a great relief at such a difficult time. We are hugely grateful to all the staff for their wonderful kindness, care, expertise and support."
7631,After I went to North staffs mind I tryed to end my life. ended up here and the doctors and nurses were great They helped alot.

8563,"Arrived 7.30, and after a 7 hour wait for an emergency c section. Sat in a room nothing to do. Midwifes don't check up"
1672,"Allergy services in hospital - AVOID! - After suffering from really bad allergies, I was referred here after my previous hospital kept pushing back and cancelling my appointments. I was promised to be seen within three months. 10 months later I was still being told I would be contacted after lockdown. After a respiratory specialist chased up the appointment because I am now having complications from such severe allergic reactions, I was told that they cancelled in February and they have refused to see me, go back to the original hospital. The receptionist I spoke to was rude and hung up when I asked why then made sarcastic comments about me when someone else phoned. Still I have no reason why these so called specialists won't see me. Meanwhile what does it matter if I can't breathe and have to be admitted to hospital? My advice is go elsewhere if you have allergies. These people don't care. Also don't tell me to contact PALS, they're as useful as a chocolate teapot. Get it sorted."
6695,"Vaccination Clinic - Today there was a 50 minute wait for the vaccination but acceptable in the circumstances. I have used the services at NDDH several times in the last 10 or so years and on the whole have been VERY satisfied. Today, in particular, everybody has been very friendly and cheerful. To me the NHS is our most valuable asset."

9596,This is where #tunbridgewellshospital @MTWnhs accomodated me in active labour after my husband was made to drive me there due to me being deemed high risk at Maidstone birth centre. Despite my fears of having another baby there. And those fears quickly became a reality. https://t.co/uBaRoeB2j6
4084,I waited a long time for bloid tests and heard another patient who was waiting being told that blood test results were available in between half an hour and 3 quarters of an hour. The attention I received from nurses and doctors was excellent.

Staff need to be more considerate - this is a repeat from my previous visit  | Staff need to be more kind"

737,"All the staff are so cheerful, polite and caring and very helpful,"
4615,"Urgent care centre - Fantastic! - I attended yesterday in a great deal of pain. I was treated quickly & efficiently. The receptionist was friendly, approachable & professional. The doctor was amazing. From my symptoms he clearly had the diagnosis & a quick examination confirmed. This doctor knew exactly the problem that others would need X-ray / scans to diagnose. I was referred straight to a major hospital with a letter with his findings. It's a shame the major hospital didn't work the same way. But after 8 hours & diagnostics they arrived at the same result that the brilliant first doctor at gravesend had said in his letter! Absolutely first class service. Thankyou., "
2002,Gynaecology - Fantastic staff - I had to have a follow up examination after a smear test showed abnormal results. I was very worried going in as abnormal results could be anything from actually being fine to cervical cancer. The staff were fantastic. Receptionist was friendly. I had two nurses who were chatty and lovely. The doctor was brilliant. She explained everything to me in clear detail and made me feel totally at ease. What could have been a really daunting experience was as pleasant as it could have been. Absolutely brilliant staff.

7957,"Perfect Practice - My comments are about Epsom Hospital. I had to go to A & E 2 days in a row and I'd like to say that the nursing staff were wonderful. They made me feel safe, secure and I could of asked for anything and they would have given it to me. A smile from a nurse can go a long way, no matter how bad things were for one particular nurse, she still kept smiling."
6531,"Used the hydro pool, very friendly staff and helpful. As for people complaining about staff and waiting times for the rest of the hospital's departments, don't blame the nurses or doctors BLAME THE MANAGEMENT AND CURRENT AND PAST GOVERNMENTS, they are the ones to blame for cuts in services, and poor bed management by PEOPLE SITTING BEHIND A DESK AND GETTING PAID THOUSANDS TO SAVE MONEY. As for the carparks they are privately run and NONE OF THE MONEY GOES BACK TO THE HOSPITAL. Even staff have to pay the exorbitant parking fees."

8755,"Orthopaedics - Exemplary Care - I had an operation on my shoulder at New Cross on 7 September as a Day-Case and the treatment I received in each department was nothing but exemplary. The Appleby Suite registration team; the anaesthetic team; the operating team (Theatre 10) and the others I never met while asleep; the Recovery Room team and the team at the Beynon Ward including the physiotherapist. I am not allowed to mention you by name but you all know who you are. I tried to thank everyone personally but this wasn't always possible so I thought I would try to formalise my response to the care I received. I think you are heroes and all ‚ÄúGold‚Äù medallists in my sight. My sincere and heartfelt thanks go to each and every one of you. I cannot thank enough my Consultant Anaesthetist who, as far back as October 2020, explained all of the procedures involved with ‚ÄúAwake Fibre-optic intubation‚Äù and sought my approval. This rebuilt my confidence well before I could get a date for the operation and everything went as described. My special thanks go to my surgeon who, even on the evening of the operation, at 8 pm, rang me to see how I was and to ensure I had understood everything that was discussed in the Recovery Room. It was totally unexpected and I think that is going the extra mile. I waited 21months to get this operation and everyone at the hospital has successfully done their job and it is now down to me to carry out the physiotherapy in the recovery stage. I am sending this in the hope my thanks will be passed on to everyone. Michael Bridgwater "
9242,Excellent and speedy service #CovidTesting @TeamNUH
2823,"The worst hospital experience I ever had. I had my appendix removed and they let me wait in a separate room for 2h without painkillers before surgery. After surgery, I was in chestnut ward, treated among others by a nurse who called herself nurse 'Comfort'. She broke a vein in me hand after injecting antibiotics and when I screamed in pain, she did not stop, she continued. A few hours after surgery I woke up in excruciating pain, and screamed, and the nurses, although in my vicinity, ignored me for a good while and only then approached me. Instead of asking what was wrong or talking to me they just gave me more painkillers. I asked for a doctor which was ignored. Upon my discharge, which was way too early as I could not walk yet, they denied me a wheelchair, saying I had to wait at least 45 minutes if I wanted a wheelchair as they didn't have one. Finally, they told me to eat lots of food after the operation, which is wrong, as I was told by a different doctor later on. It led to me having issues after the operations and having to go to a different hospital a day later. So they medically I'll advised me. I will formally complain but before I do this, I hope this post will stop future patients from choosing this hospital."
626,Throughout everything was very good but just once I was left in my car and did not get a call to go in for my treatment which caused a problem. Thats why I scored you a 2 instead of 1. Perhaps I should have scored 1 1/2.
7994,All on very well organised and efficient. Nothing to complain about whatsoever.

2866,"Urgent Treatment Centre - Worst emergency department - I was today 17/07/2021 in Queens hospital, emergency department as my daughter had an injury, we entered at hospital at 21:00 pm and they told us waiting time is two hours, after two hours and half I asked the receptionist is it going to be long, they told me maybe one hour, then after 1 hours asked again, they told me I have only two people in front, I was all time in setting area with my daughter, at 01:30 am my daughter asked the receptionist is my turn now, they told us you are not in the system, maybe you missed your turn, I was shocked. 5 hours waiting I'm not in the list been told to rebook . I took my daughter home, I prey to God that my daughter will be alright until I check her to on other hospital as) Queens hospital) this hospital has the worst doctors, and service is horrible. "
9067,"Was supposed to go to the emergency department as my husband called the ambulance for me and they didn't have anything at that moment so we were advised to go by ourselves, I was having severe abdominal pain like 10 on 10 and crying and in agony basically, once there I was left in pain in the area where they check you first and decide whether you should go to a&e or a gp! My husband went to park the car, while he was away I was bending over in pain as I was unable to stand straight because of the pain.after 15 minutes my husband came back and saw me still at the same position he left me and everyone was looking at me how I was crying and how in pain I was, including the staff! This was a very bad experience I never expected this and will never forget the inhuman treatment that I received while in PAIN and agony! Finally after about 30 minutes I was checked and rushed to the a&e area and was admitted for 3 days! Thank you Hillingdon hospital!!! NOT!!! "
4603,Really helpful staff nurses made us feel safe and comfortable
948,"Extremely poor A&E sector. Been 3 times all times had to wait ridiculious amount of times withuout any guidance. Do not take patients professionally . Imagine in emergency section there is more than one waiting and some inapropiate nurse coming to say whos next, no one knows which is next and that should be done by seriousness of the case not by who have the loudest voice. Then after 3 hours of waiting and irritation they ask to speak with staff politelly or they will be asked to go out. That what we should be thanking for NHS? I know that it is not easy job to take care of people health but definatelly that is nor how emergency service should be provided, you can bloody die while you waiting and then they will blame CVD ...."
6276,"The doctor took his time to understand my issue - Everyone I came across in this department where wonderful. I felt very relaxed and taken care of throughout my time there. The doctor took his time to understand my issue and listen to me. I also had to have a biopsy done, I was quite nervous as I have had this procedure done before and the doctor who carried it out did not listen to me when I said I could still feel it and it was extremely painful. I told the doctor who carried out my procedure this and she took her time to make sure I was comfortable and I could not feel a thing. I couldn't have asked for a better experience whilst I was there. Thank you!!! "

No mention of hysteroscopy or patient leaflet so thought I was only going to discuss scan results and was very shocked when told about procedure. The lead nurse was wonderful - offered alternative dates and explained procedure in detail. Went ahead and the lead nurse and her two assistants were marvelous. It was painful but they were all so professional, encouraging, respectful, friendly and talked me through everything that was happening. It was after 5 o clock but as I had not been expecting the procedure was a bit shaky they sat me in a quiet room and made me a cup of tea. I worked in a small community team in the NHS and really appreciated the wonderful care I was given. This hysteroscopy nurse and her team deserve medals they were absolutely brilliant."

821,"Excellent treatment in the outpatient department from Dr Kenneth ( sorry, not sure of your surname). Can't fault treatment received from him, even following up with a phone call to let me know blood results. The only negative was the length of time it took to get through A&E to have my blood taken and to get the results - 6 hours was a bit much."
1914,The department was calm clean professional & very friendly during this recently out of lockdown time where I felt as safe as I could be under the current circumstances.
4784,"Really disappointed that a good friend of mine, is unable to get the medication she desperately needs, due to annual leave at the hospital. She requires a picc line to be fitted to get on top of an infection, but has been told only 1 person at the hospital can do these and there are delays due to holiday. My friend knows from experience that not acting quickly, means a struggle and potential hospitalisation if the infection is allowed to run rife. A dangerous situation for her due to the complexities of her illness. In addition - delays in treatment, will lead to further delays in her receiving her pain relief meds. She is currently in daily agony and in pain, bed bound with a small child to look after. Surely another member of staff or even hospital could look to get her the treatment she needs. Her care has been brilliant to this point but this doesn't feel good enough SAD It's miserable"

5372,"I came to North Mid with a sprained foot a few days after I had injured myself, so I wasn't exactly an urgent case. I was handed down the chain of staff, all of whom were very kind, introduced themselves and explained things clearly. They didn't even get cross with me for accidentally pressing an emergency stop button in the X-ray room instead of the green door release button, which caused their systems to shut down. They ended up apologising to me for the delay. I was given good advice about my foot and also an immobilisation boot. My experience today was very good! Shout out to Jeanne at A&E and all the others who saw me today. And apologies to the X-ray imaging operators for disrupting their systems! "

Then a staff member appeared & told me to go to the nurse, but they were reading a book. Another was on phone. So awkward & took about 5 mins for them to notice me! I was so nervous but the only 1 there & the staff just looked bored & didn't really help me. Then I was only 1 sitting there with so many staff chatting behind me so I just got up & went."

It didn't feel like an emergency but an optician friend told me it was. I had to wait 5 hours because there was only one eye doctor on call, but when he came he was amazing. He said I had a torn retina which needed urgent treatment before it became detached. The eye treatment centre is closed at the weekend, but he asked Security to unlock it.

938,"Urgent Treatment Centre - Kindness, Expertise and Good Humour - So grateful to the nurse that attended to me today when I wasn't feeling my best . A perfect blend of all the above . Lovely hospital where patients genuinely matter "
1184,"Poor - I spoke to a doctor about how I've been feeling last night, when I went into see them for another issue. Initially felt like I was actually getting help as had a call from a lovely lady in the Crisis Team at Grantham within 2 hours. She arranged an appointment for me to go in at 6pm on Monday. Lady called today to cancel the appointment and no real effort made to help. When I said it was fine forget it she went okay. Reaching out was hard, and now I'm back to square one. Lesson learned, there is no help out there, and the world really is as awful a place as I believe. Shouldn't have bothered"
1386,"Cardiology - Woeful - Going round in circles, departments don't talk to each other or simply don't keep records up to date. Referred from one department to another for reasons that don't exist, who referred me back again. So instead of a 2 month wait it'll now be a 4 month wait. Unqualified individuals making these decisions as well, at the very least I'd expect to be seen by someone qualified to refer me elsewhere. Not at all frustrating."

9247,"General Surgery - Staff great, let down by everything else - The actual doctors / surgeons and nursing staff as faultless small issues with not quite having enough of them for the number of people on wards but understandable. However I cannot write anything Positive about the Hospital stay itself. The food is what can only be described as simply vile and inedible. When you are expecting patients to eat and sleep to recover it seems we can't get either of those right, the wards are full of constant noise which can be managed, but when the mattresses on the bed are clearly passed end of life and being kept going but lying on them for more than half an hour is painful no matter how you move. The worse though is food I have been here over a week now and have never once even been asked what I wanted to eat?! ? Other times they have even just simply forgotten to bring my food or forgotten to order it. The whole thing is a runny joke now the only two acceptable items seems to be the yoghurts or the drinks and they seem to be provided by a supplier out side the main caterer that really just sums it up. I have had both the chicken and the tomato soup both of which have been simply inedible to the point where the quality and consistency of them makes you physically gag, my point would be if you are staying here expect to spend a lot of money in the shops or bring a shops worth of food with you. And if they do forget to bring you food don't forget them to make up for it by bringing you something else as they abandon you and go well the next meal coming at some point! Be warned the mealtimes are also a ridiculous intervals, and during my stay have been offered one cup of tea in total it's meant to be twice a day with snacks as well! "
1176,"Why is literally everyone in this hospital so rude! So unhelpful time wasting, missinforming and generally inept. Honestly the culture here is revolting."
2611,"Today- another day checking in on older vulnerable people in Sutton - helping get people home from hospital, ensuring they've food, checking they're ok, chatting, reassuring, ‚Äúwiping‚Äù tears, alerting GPs when needed and all this ‚Äòcos we care -Proud to be @AgeUKSutton #BigNightIn"

We received no confirmation of the booking and tried several times to get in contact with Bloods Reception, with no avail. Ot simply played a pre recorded message and cut out. Phoning through the Lister Switchboard led to being put through and the phone cutting out again. By the time we did get through, 45 minutes before the appointment, the person on the end of the phone had the sheer audacity to tell us we were cutting it fine. Terrible patient care and communication. Sort yourselves out."

8286,"Strongly recommended! I woke up the other night with very uncomfortable chest / upper back pain and breathlessness, and took myself to hospital. I was processed and streamed into A&E quickly by staff who took my symptoms seriously, even though I'm young & female, so not a stereotypical chest pain patient. . Once into A&E the staff were friendly, pleasant, and happy to answer my questions - I felt reassured that I was in good hands! I gave them a hard time drawing blood (my vei...ns and arteries are very deep in my arms), for which they were needlessly apologetic, but their bedside manner was so lovely that I just enjoyed chatting with the nurses and doctors I met. I can also compliment their blood drawing techniques as relatively painless - plus I usually bruise badly, but this time I'm almost bruise-free! Thanks for all your help - I hope I won't need another A&E trip anytime soon but if I do, I hope I'm nearby! "

5764,"Don't know - Xray department - I want to leave this review because this needs looking in to. I am asthmatic and was sent for a chest x-ray because I have had severe breathing issues since March. NHS guidance states I am exempt from wearing a mask although I still try to wear one. I cant breathe after about 30 seconds of wearing one. Despite me repeating this over and over 3 members of staff continued to say I had to, even after I said I was going dizzy. I was then told that well they had to wear masks all day. My arms were pulled back for they x-ray without checking that was ok and this pulled on my shoulder injury. I had no idea this was going to happen or I would have said I had one. I was in a vulnerable state after them asking me to remove one gown, I was left with one on that was open at the back, going dizzy and then facing forward I had no idea my arms were going to be pulled back. I gave the utmost respect for the nhs and none was unkind, but I feel this experience was unnerving and could have had a much more impactful effect on someone less resilient. Why dont your staff stick to mask exemption guidelines? "

I was put in a room left until doctor came some hours later put on pulse monitor told to walk around 40 steps then told me it was ok now I can go home . Apart from taking blood nobody did any observation on me at all from coming into hospital until the doctor came in . When the ambulance guys was at my house my heart rate was going up and down I would have thought going into hospital it would have been monitored. Not just for 5 mins .

9049,"Gynaecology - Wonderful staff - I was seen by a trainee consultant and experienced nurse. They were kind, polite and professional. They listened very carefully to what I said, and gave clear, well explained, answers to questions. I was treated in a respectful and friendly way which made me feel safe in their hands. I know they will find the best solutions to my difficulties. I've been referred to this department in the past, and been similarly well treated. Thanks you Drs and Nurses of the NHS, you're amazing. "
3153,I answered 1 because I was happy with your service.
9746,I suppose it's a nice hospital. Completed my apprenticeship here.
1674,"Lack of empathy and information - Having seen by the GP previous day I had to take my 10 month old child to Emergency Department as was feeling very poorly, crying in pain, not slept the whole night, not eating and drinking and no improvement in symptoms. In the Paediatric A & E we were called in by the triage nurse for initial assessment. While I was explaining the symptoms to the triage nurse, a senior nurse just came in and had a superficial look at my child for few seconds and told the triage nurse to send us to GP surgery linked to hospital ignoring my presence there. I felt this approach was very inconsiderate. They might be seing plenty of cases like that of my child's everyday but for me it is a stressful situation. I would expect little more assessment and explanation with empathy while talking to a worried parent. The GP we saw was excellent and did a proper assessment of my child. "
4135,"Completely unacceptable levels of basic care - Three weeks ago, my GP surgery called me at home and explained, that following my recent blood test results, coupled with ongoing symptoms, I was being referred under the 2 week urgent wait referral for Bowel Cancer. I was told that I would be seen ASAP. Last week, my GP admitted me to hospital as they were concerned at my iron levels and dehydration. I was initially admitted to the MEAU Ward. My vitals were checked and I was hooked up to an intravenous drip. The staff on this ward were lovely. At midnight, I was awoken by one of the nurses, explaining that I would be moving wards. I packed my belongings and waited...2 hours later, a porter arrived and wheeled my bed to Carlton / Colbey ward. It took the staff here 40 minutes to check me in and I was finally left to sleep at 3am... This is where my nightmare began: - I was freezing cold, having only been left with the original sheet from the MEAU. I asked for a blanket but was told they had ran out. I had to use my dressing gown to keep warm. - my husband tried to bring me a blanket in the following day, but was told he couldn't due to Covid. - in the 4 days I was there, my bed was changed once. The same blood stained sheet from where my cannula had been put in remained on my bed throughout my stay. - the most difficult symptom I had was severe diarrhea. I was opening my bowels on average of 15 to 20 times a day. The diarrhea was watery and extremely strong smelling. The side room I was given had no toilet. When the nurse checked me in, they asked the member of staff which toilet I should use, and the response was ‚Äúshe can't use the toilets. She'll have to make do with a commode...‚Äù A commode was then wheeled in. I was obviously concerned about this but was told, ‚Äúas soon as you've used it, press your buzzer and Someone will come straight away to empty it...‚Äù - on average, it took the staff 20/25 minutes to respond to the buzzer. On one occasion, I had filled the bowl with diarrhea and it took so long for someone to respond to the buzzer, that I had to go again. My tiny room was now filled with the stench of 2 lots of diarrhea...and STILL no one came to help me. My husband arrived to visit during this episode and was, quite rightly, very angry. He found a member of staff and insisted it was collected. This became typical of my experience... - the nurses kept asking for a stool sample. It was difficult for me as my stools were very much liquid form. On 2 occasions, where I did manage to provide a ‚Äòsolid' stool, the night team accidentally threw it away without keeping some for testing. - the majority of staff were agency and didn't know my situation. - every morning, I was seen by a doctor and each time was told that I needed a Colonoscopy and CT scan (I already knew this, as I had already been referred under the 2 week wait). However, the day would come and go and nothing would happen. After 3 long days of being in hospital, a member of the endoscopy team came to see me on the ward. They were angry that I had been in for so long without being seen. They told me that the ward were to blame and that my notes had only been sent that day. They said, ‚Äúif we had known you needed a colonoscopy when you arrived...we would have given you one when you arrived. You have only been referred today...‚Äù - I was obviously really upset about this. I then asked the ward to make sure that I had actually been referred for the CT scan. No one could answer me. One nurse said I had been referred for an x-ray but had no date. I did not need an x-Ray. I was told that I was ‚Äòon the wrong ward...' so they had ‚Äòprobably just forgotten about me...' - On day 4, I was finally seen by the endoscopy unit. Because a colonoscopy takes a lot of prep, I was given a sigmoidoscopy instead as this only required an enema. However, after the sigmoidoscopy, the consultant said I still needed the full colonoscopy and CT scan. I was so fed up at this point that I asked if I could be seen as an out-patient instead. They agreed and said I could go home. - when I got back to the ward, I was told it would take a while for the discharge papers to be ready. In the meantime, I asked for my cannula to be removed. The nurse agreed and said they'd ‚Äòbe right back...' 2 hours later, I had to ask again. They said, ‚ÄòOops, I forgot...I'll do it now...' and then left the room and didn't return! Half an hour later, when they came to check my blood pressure - I asked for a 3rd time. They then proceeded to show me their hand and said, ‚Äòsorry, I wrote it on my hand (in black felt-tip) to remind myself but it's been wiped off...' and said, ‚Äòlet me get rid of this machine (blood pressure) and I'll come back and do it...and then left...and STILL didn't come back!!! FOUR hours after initially asking, I pressed my buzzer and a different nurse came in. They took it out straight away (it took seconds). I came home on Saturday evening. I was told by the endoscopy team that I was still an urgent case so would have the appointments through ASAP. I was advised to leave it until Tuesday and if I hadn't heard from the hospital, then to ring them. Tuesday I rang. I was passed around a number of people who didn't know how to help. Eventually, I was put through to my consultant's secretary. I expected to ring and to be given the dates for the colonoscopy and CT. however; instead I was informed that my notes were STILL on the ward and that the discharge paperwork had not been completed - she said it appeared that I was still in hospital. I left 4 days ago. This is absolute abandonment. I cannot get an appointment until the ward requests it. I left 4 days ago, yet my notes are still on the ward and the discharge paperwork has still not been signed. I was told 3 weeks ago now that i needed an urgent appointment to check for bowel cancer. I was told I would be seen within 2 weeks. Despite having spent 4 days in hospital, I am no closer to having any answers. If anything, my hospital stay has slowed everything down. I still don't have the appointments. Whilst I fully appreciate that the hospital is short staffed, it is completely unacceptable to not even have the basic level of care. Additionally, I cannot accept that Covid has played any part in this poor treatment. Lincolnshire has one of the lowest rates and Lincoln hospital has a very minimal number of cases. I was, quite simply, forgotten about. I was put onto a ward where I was left to sit in my own faeces. My experience has left me upset, emotional, depressed and anxious. After ringing the hospital today, I have no confidence that I will be seen. The secretary confirmed that I was ‚Äòstill an urgent case' and they could see the urgent referral. If you are not going to see patients within 2 weeks - then please don't call it a 2 week referral. I have always hailed the NHS. I have had a number of procedures over the years and have never, ever complained. I am very tolerant and understanding and am always very grateful for NHS care..however, I honestly can't let this go. The treatment I received in Lincoln hospital was appalling. I just hope that I haven't got cancer and that this hideous experience, and continued delay, will not have a negative impact on my health.

4563,"Cardiothoracic surgery - Superb patient care - In November I had my aortic valve replaced. Right from the initial fitness-for-surgery review through to discharge the quality of the nursing care was superb, even when I became a 'difficult patient' for a few hours one night. Everyone walks around with a smile on their face, and when a problem arises it is sorted out quickly by the team. Because the hospital specialises in cardiothoracic surgery everyone knows exactly what they are doing, and if needed works as a team to solve the problem. When it comes to patient well-being any 'hierarchy' is completely invisible. I was fortunate to be in a side ward for the final few days of recovery and when I pressed the handset for assistance a nurse appeared within 30 seconds or so. Amazing! The range of food was excellent and there was free wi-fi, thought not quite up to supporting video streaming! Every nurse had their given name prominent on their badge and that helped me see them as individual carers and not as 'a nurse'. My only frustration was that at ward rounds the doctors tended to talk about me to the nursing staff, and not give me a chance to check with them directly on my progress. Unlike the nursing staff it was very difficult to see their name badges. Fortunately there was an SHO who came round most days and made a point of explaining to me what was going on. It is now almost four weeks since my operation and my recovery has exceeded my expectations, though there is still some way to go. Overall, if you have a choice of hospital for the procedure I received then choose Harefield. I will never forget the professionalism of all the staff, the way in which each nurse helped me along the road of recovery and above all the smiles as they did so. Thank you! "
2447,"Breast cancer services - Exemplary Care, Poor Communication - Cannot fault the care and medical attention this hospital offers. The staff are always professional, approachable and good humoured. I attend regularly for ongoing cancer treatment. Many members of my family have also experienced excellent medical care and services from this hospital and attend for follow up appointments or treatment throughout the year. However, the communication and appointments system leaves a lot to be desired. I would suggest that the percentage of no-shows you have for appointments would be much lower if the clerical side of the business got their act together. Duplicate appointments, non-communication when there should be some, one hand not knowing what the other is doing and communication between ward and the pharmacy resulting in non-delivery of drugs, are regular occurrences. I appreciate the impact Covid19 has had on the hospital's administration departments and treatment has been transferred to outreach facilities with some efficiency. The communication and administration difficulties my family and I have encountered has (for us), been a problem for the last 5 years. It is all time and money that is being wasted in my opinion. Sort those problems and you have a first class hospital!! "

1542,Lack of parking always makes a visit difficult as I cannot walk easily. Also clearer signposting is needed. I walked straight past X-ray and not for the first time.

We were both treated with the highest respect and care and I'm delighted to report that the treatment they gave ensure that on follow-up today, a week later, the fractures were still aligned and no surgery required. Also special thanks to the Radiographer on the night of 19th January who was so careful and patient, making sure that the X-ray examination was conducted with a minimal amount of pain.

I called the urology ward and they said to attend A&E. I am Covid phobic as my dad has leukaemia. I needn't have worried one bit! The care from every I met was exemplary. Hand sanitizer was in abundance and most areas were sparkling clean. This was echoed during my brief stay on Ward 621. I would like to thank everyone involved in my care. It was the NHS at its best. Now for the not so good, the only 2 areas I would criticise were the sub waiting room in A&E where the wall to the right corner was disgusting where people's head had been on it and dried blood was all over the floor, and as I left the main lift nearest the window was disgusting. Such a shame, it looked unkept, tissue paper on the floor and dried blood. It had been there a while. Of course I understand it could have happened a minute after the deep clean five hours ago. Just was just frustrating after a fab visit. I didn't even feel the need to strip, sanitise and shower the moment I walked in the door. Thank you so much "

In any other NHS department this would have been 7 separate appointments spread over several months. Well done."

I feel so fortunate to have two IBD nurses who I can phone when my disease is flaring, the team always listen and plan tests that maybe required. They keep informed about any test results and phone to check on my well being, I would not cope with this disease so well if I did not have the support that is provided by the Airedale IBD team. During Covid times when it has been very difficult to see a GP, I have been able to phone the advice line, this is a true lifeline and I cannot thank them enough. Thank you "

8395,
2863,Diagnostic Imaging - Great service. - Went today for a foot x-ray and arrived knowing I also needed an ultrasound but because of the different 'systems' I could book one over the phone and the ultrasound via my GP referring me. The x-ray appointment was organised with 2 weeks and I still hadn't heard about the ultrasound! But when I arrived the radiologist saw the request from podiatry and arranged for me to have the ultrasound before my x-ray - how amazing 2 birds one stone which rarely happens within the NHS. Great service and huge thanks that I didn't have to attend the same department again and that all results will be with the GP and podiatry at the same time. Thank you.
3560,Very satisfied and impressed yet again with the professional greeting I got from the receptionist and I was impressed to observe that the consultant's promise to me was fulfilled with me being the only person in the department at that time ‚Ä¶
7308,"If you haven't got Covid and are an older person you don't want to end up here, because you won't survive. My husband was 80 and had a seizure, he was put in intensive care and I was told he was the sickest person in the hospital, but then he was moved out of ICU because they wanted to keep the beds for possible new cases of Covid. I was constantly told by young doctors that they wouldn't do anything to save him or revive him if he had another seizure or if he had a heart attack. They seemed totally cold and uncaring while I was in complete and utter shock and traumatised. Most of the nurses were wonderful and did their best for him and he seemed to be getting better, but then one night he had a stroke and nobody noticed until the morning when they found he was paralysed down one side. He never recovered and now I am left devastated after losing him. Before he went in with the seizure he was quite a strong fit person, he had a heart scan that said his heart was functioning very well for his age and he had no cough or chest problems. After being in this hospital for a couple of weeks, he had a chest infection and his heart function had gone down to functioning at only 30 percent Cause of death was pneumonia and heart failure!! "

9399,If your ever bored in the Scouselandia area and break your hip i highly reccomend a visit to Aintree University Hospital. From the chauffeur driven transport to the reception made me feel like a valued guest. A and E should be renamed the Welcome centre as your greeted by such caring staff. During my brief stay in this area i met very busy guest providers who care for your needs. Transported by the internal personnel movement teams i was lucky enough to see there magic lamp show that makes an image of your insides. Following a lecture from an eminent speaker in that will sting in the morning i was transported to the equally delightful budget end of the establishment. Shown to my 4 star room they laid on afternoon entertainment including juggling acts and what seemed to be a hidden advert for cleaning products as the place was spotless. After a nights sleep on one of Hillroms finest Avantgard1200 beds they offered me a trip to the theatre. I was lucky as several of the cast members came to visit prior to my show. Sorry to say it was boring as i seem to have slept through the performance and woke up in what seemed a masquarade ball going by all the masks. Joking aside highly recommend this place. Your true angels.
9553,Diabetic Medicine - Excellent - Took my daughter to see the paediatric diabetic team. We were very anxious as this is a new diagnosis but we were seen so quickly lovely friendly staff the doctor took her time to explain things. We then had to go to hemel to pick a blood machine up and the diabetes nurse was so patient and went though everything with us. We also saw the dietitian who has given us help and advice. 
9897,"I felt listened to - I completed the year-long MBT Therapy group at the Mandala Centre. I found it helpful as I was able to discuss issues that arose for week to week, in a supportive and validating environment. It was useful to recognise where I had lost my mentalizing and to receive suggestions on how to manage situations better in the future. It also helped me by being prompted to share my struggles, especially ones I would not normally discuss, as it helped me to confront issues I would have otherwise potentially ignored. I feel the therapy has impacted on my daily life in that I am better at mentalizing, maintaining relationships, better and managing grief. I am currently not self-harming and I've reduced my alcohol consumption to a more healthy / helpful level. I find I can walk away and hold my tongue better when dealing with difficult and testing people. I found the facilitators very caring, understanding and validating, with great insight and knowledge and it was an absolute pleasure to work in my issues alongside them with their unwavering support. They made me feel listened to and they inspired self-belief in myself. Thank you tremendously"

5932,"Staff were polite, appointment was on time, overall was a good patient experience"
6497,"No water offered or given in A&E - No water is offered in A&E anymore. From the point of arrival, it's become normal to not be offered water (or a hot drink) & to not receive water until being admitted & transferred to one of the Wards. When you are alone in A&E, especially out of hours, and particularly when attached to monitoring equipment, IV infusions, or are too unwell to mobilise, there is no means of the patient accessing refreshment themselves either. However, A&E staff can be clearly seen drinking at the desk within the Emergency Department. On many occasions, having not been offered any, I've politely asked staff for water. All of those I asked agreed to get some, but none actually returned with it. On one attendance, I asked 3 different members of staff for water, but still didn't receive any. One member of staff audibly tutted and rolled their eyes when I asked for water a 2nd time, having waited for around an hour after asking for the first time, knowing how busy staff are, and not wanting to be a nuisance, when they have far more important tasks to be getting on with. Since waiving the 4 hour A&E waiting time target, it is not uncommon for me to be in the Emergency Department for anywhere between 4 & 8+ hours before being taken to a Ward, which is quite a long time considering that the majority of patients are acutely unwell, immobile, vulnerable, disorientated, in pain, tired and anxious. Compromised patients don't need to add dehydration to their woes. Given the very nature of an Emergency Department, it's highly likely that the majority of attenders were not expecting to find themselves attending A&E that day, and for that reason, are also not likely to have been in a position to plan ahead, to make sure they brought refreshments with them. Unfortunately, I'm not alone in this experience. I know several other patients who have said exactly the same. I don't understand why this problem exists, as it certainly never used to in my experience."

6202,"Ophthalmology - Poor Nurse patient management - Ive had multiple visits to the RDE over the past 5 years. I am full of respect and admiration for the staffs dedication and commitment to great patient care - however after a recent visit to the ophthalmology department I encountered a nurse who is determined to destroy RDE's reputation as well as my own reputation. After the visit I received a letter from the NHS, copied to my GP, explaining the consultants consultation. Within this letter the Nurse carrying out the eye test has decided to add derogatory comments about me and her opinion about my visit for the eye test. Her comments are not accurate and gives the patient no recourse to her opinion except here in this forum."

The waiting area is bright, roomy and very clean with a calm atmosphere. A high standard of efficiency and cleanliness was apparent in the clinic area too. We would have no hesitation recommending this unit to anyone who needs endoscopy services. Walking through the ground floor area of EDGH, it was busy but remained clean and tidy. Car parking is always a worry but we found a space after a few minutes so were very early for the appointment. All in all, a very positive experience at an anxious time."

After a few days I realised it was a nursing home for the elderly and not the rehabilitation hospital I had been lead to believe it was.My husbands treatment / care was non existant and I could see a complete deterioration in him, he was unable to walk unaided and seemed very confused and distant and aging rapidly. I discharged him and brought him home, no assisance was offered when I reached home, other than a daily visit from a nurse, which I had to push for, to dress a wound in he's upper leg. Had I left him in Alton I feel sure he would now be either in a a residential home or, no longer with us at all. He is now much better, but, not fully recovered, . That was 1 year ago almost."
1081,"Emergency Abdominal Surgery - Very Pleased - I was here for a gallbladder removal and found the team to be just fabulous. Leading up to the appointment I found I had no information and found it all very uncertain with the pre-op team but that was due to it being at different hospitals and some via phone and letter. Once I was there I was reassured and welcomed by the staff who were all very friendly and very informative. I found I was very looked after and never felt like I was a burden. I was very nervous and the surgeons and anesthesiologists especially were so good at keeping me calm. The surgery went well but I did take quite bad to the anesthesia, nobody's fault just how I reacted, but again I was looked after and didn't feel rushed to go home. My only complaint would be that I wasn't given any pain relief the second day due to the doctors not prescribing any, but the nurses were doing the best at chasing this up and felt they really did all they could. In light of the current circumstances our NHS are absolutely invaluable and I can't thank them enough for there wonderful professionalism, kindness and treatment with my surgery. Thank you "

The second session required the theatre skills of the Gastro Consultant and his kindness and informative approach does a lot to inspire confidence and trust. I felt that I was in good hands. In my opinion this departmental team is a great role model for all NHS services. If you are nervous or worried about a procedure in Gastro Solihull, believe me, you dont need to be. You will be in excellent hands. "
5079,"How inept is the NHS especially this hospital, waiting 8 hours to be seen by a doctor, some people waiting 10 hours . You can tell it's poorly ran and understaffed . Be prepared to be in a waiting room at A&E with absolutely no seating and no staff. Clearly the worst wait times ive experienced, go somewhere else."
5227,"Accident and emergency services - Fantastic care - My seven month old baby was ill so I rang 111 who advised me to bring her to the children's a and e. I was terrified to do this because of COVID 19 however we were put straight into an isolated room, the staff were so proficient with their PPE and I felt completely safe. I'm amazed at how they continue to be so calm, compassionate and caring in the circumstances in which they are working. I'd forgotten my nappies and charger in my rush but this was all sorted out for me without a second thought. I'm so glad I did go as she did have an infection and if I didn't it would've been worse. Thank you so much to all. Hard to describe how reassuring it is to be able to rely on your services for children particularly. I wish I could thank personally but hope this will filter through. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. "

5347,"Respiratory Medicine - Exceptional care - I was transferred to the High dependency respiratory unit and would like to pass on my praise of the whole team. Apart from their professionalism, it is their care I would particularly like to commend. During an extremely frightening time for myself, the way that everything was explained to me, the compassion and dignity shown was fantastic. It made a very scary experience all the much easier to handle. Especially in these unprecedented times in which I'm sure your staff have their own personal difficulties to manage, their service and care never faltered and for which I am extremely grateful. "
2530,Don't know - Great experience - Excellent Service today at Erith Urgent Care we were seen quickly the only criticism was we had to stand outside for 40 minutes in a queue with no cover well done all of you Well organised.

5065,Urology - Excellent service - My husband was referred for an MRI scan by his urologist This was completed on a Sunday results received Thursday biopsy needed This was set for Saturday.Completed without any embarrassment and very skilfully. Results not good so bone scan requested. The staff on the nuclear medicine centre were brilliant and put us at ease. Only waited a week for the results and although some treatment is needed no progression to bones. LL the staff we have met along this journey since May have been fantastic. Thank you everyone. My only complaint is the car park.ie not being able to get on it and having to pay 6.50 to park in the multi storey. Surely if you have an appointment there should be spaces allocated for this purpose.
3439,"Excellent service - December's appointment in the Urology Department was one of many I have had since February 2020 - I have nothing but praise for all the staff who looked after me. They have been kind, caring and informative - I am very grateful to everyone, thankyou so much "

A huge thank you Gary Bowers "
7274,"Diagnostic Endoscopy - Sensitive Response to Anxious Patient - Last week I had to attend for a gastroscopy. This is a very anxiety inducing procedure for me so I was very fearful. I would like to compliment all the nursing staff in particular. Everyone was professional, friendly and empathetic. (As were the reception staff) The insertion of a cannula for sedation was performed as quickly and painlessly as possible and to my amazement I did not have any bruising when it was removed. Unfortunately there was some difficulty in inserting the endoscopy tube so I did come to to find myself coughing and gagging but thanks to the sedation and my awareness of gentle and caring nurses encouraging me I felt detached from the process an not too traumatised. The doctor was friendly and unpatronising. As an extra comment I would add that I loved the sign board celebrating the different nationalities of the staff working in the department. This is so important in these times of division between people and lack of respect coming from a high level for people who wish to make their home in this country. The department was obviously run efficiently but humanity was not sacrificed in the process. I hope you can get this message to the department. Thank you. Liz Cruse"
1544,The physiotherapist is very patient and explains the reason for each exercises and does a thorough check of the actions.
5236,"Whilst the actual surgery appears to have been very good, it was a complete lack of follow-up, sharing of knowledge, Dr rounds, lack of coordination and poor hygiene in toilets and wards."

1940,"Don't know - Outstanding Professionals - I have visited the department for nuclear medicine twice for investigative purposes to aid diagnosis. The team in this department are exceptional in their concern for patients and thoroughly professional. On my recent visit towards the end of June, the staff treated me with respect and explained all the procedures in detail despite the issues around COVID-19 and the busy schedule. I praised the staff on the day but such dedication deserves a wider audience - including NHS management. An excellent team representing the NHS at its best. I even received a courtesy call afterwards to indicate further investigation was not warranted at this time. A thoughtful and reassuring call. Thank you for everything."
6561,As I got called by a nurse I said here then I heard her say I'll go and get your notes but an hour went past until I got told anything if she had said we were wondering where you were sitting then at least we weren't in the dark more communication needed | Just more communication

6996,"Adult Mental Illness - Wonderful caring dedicated staff - My wife was a patient in The Mount, having been sectioned and diagnosed with Parkinson's Psychosis, initially spending two months in Ward 4 and then seven months in Dementia Ward 2. On entering either ward we immediately found that all the staff were very dedicated, calm and professional, efficiently caring for patients with mental illness. We were regularly informed by the doctors and nurses, of the different medications being prescribed. Also with the ramifications and potential side effects of the various anti-psychotic drugs available. Ward 2's patience, friendliness and kindness made my wife's seven months stay extra special going above and beyond in the excellent care, understanding and support they provided. They were always very caring and understanding towards our family too being utmost professional, kind and supportive especially on difficult days. A Big Thank You to The Mount ‚ÄúKeep doing what you are doing as we know how vital your roles are in helping patients and their families in the hardest times of life‚Äù."

4711,"First baby scan - We visited Croydon hospital for our first pregnancy scan. Sadly our experience was ruined by a rude interaction with a receptionist and a nurse whos' service was poor. They wasn't friendly, no explanations and almost made us feel like we shouldn't be there! For us it was supposed to be a magical day but we were rushed in although we arrive early, no conversation, no explanation as to what's happening in the scan. An image pretty much thrown at us and no goodbye! It was terrible service. My partner had to wait outside with the other men until called, in a tiny area, huddled together.... not exactly covid safe. He was then treated like he wasn't even involved in the scan, such a shame."
7912,The worse A&E receptionist goes to Newham hospital unhelpful. Don't Expect them to help you or have empathy. They will lie front of you and back up each other. The doctors and nurses are good however when you see those nasty receptionist at A&E you will have a high blood pressure.

4774,I went for an op there yesterday. The level of care was outstanding. All of the staff were caring and kind. All hospitals should aspire to be this good.
506,The staff - good. Food - good. But in the Guildford Ward the rooms are too bare. It drives you crazy. Just having something like a tv would do wonders. I self discharged because the rooms made me have constant anxiety because there was nothing to distract me

2166,I was seen in good time and the reception staff and Dr I saw were all pleasant and informative. I also received my follow up appointment very quickly. I opted for taking a short notice appointment which I think is a very good idea. As with most hospitals the only issue I have is that parking is difficult. ** some text is missing **

4217,"Haematology - 'Blooming fantastic' staff - I have been receiving chemotherapy treatment on the unit for the last six months. To its' credit the Trust has gone to exceptional lengths to protect vulnerable patients like myself during the Coronovirus crisis by moving all cancer services to Pontefract. The haematology unit has been moved twice to different areas of the hospital during this time to ensure a larger safer environment and also a protected route into the unit. The staff has dealt with all this disruption with amazing professionalism and ensured that for patients it was 'business as usual'. I have been cared for by a number of staff during this time but everyone of the nursing and support staff have been 'blooming fantastic'. They are have been caring, kind, reassuring and nothing is too much trouble for them. I simply can not thank them enough. They are a credit to the trust and it should be proud of every one of them."
9860,Had surgery here and wow what an experience. Truly delightful to stay here the staff were very caring and attentive! I received excellent care from all staff during my stay. Very very clean and it was a pleasure to be here. I'd happily come back here all the time in the future. 5 stars
4832,"Worlds worst hospital! Doctors change every hours and they don't seem to pass on information! Had to repeat myself constantly. Told every doctor that I am allergic to paracetamol and the last doctor tried to force paracetamol on me! Then had a doctor tell me he was going to cut me open when I ask why as the X-ray, mri and ct had showed no issues, he just said he thought it was best!!! If you can't give a reason for cutting someone open maybe don't do it!! I went home against medical advise after being told I would die at home and that my temp would never go down‚Ä¶.guess what I didn't die and my temp was down the next day!!!

She collapsed at home and was taken by a very efficient ambulance crew to hospital.There a doctor from the stroke unit assessed her and arranged a CT scan and admittance. The staff nurse and occupational therapist were superb at keeping me informed and my mother is now at home making a good recovery. The NHS at its best. Thank you.
701,Superb First Class service. I am so impressed especially in current COVID crisis. Was at Whits end over the Easter Bank Holiday and contacted Orthodontist who's answer phone referred me to The BOS. I contacted them by Email and the University contacted me first thing Easter Monday. We were seen that day and Bravo all is now Well. Thank you Ann and Dave you know who you are! 
5635,"New Breast Screening Machine - I went for my 3-yearly breast screening service today at the mobile service in Sittingbourne, Kent. The woman before me commented that it didn't hurt so much as there are new machine. However, I beg to differ. Nearly 30 years ago I had a left lumpectomy, and left lymph nodes removal which caused scarring. The operative explained, in a very pleasant way, that they had to ensure the scarred area was included. This made the 2 screenings on the left side very painful and I saw to my horror, when dressing, that I was already heavily bruised under the nipple. The bruise is dark brown at least 3cm long and 1cm wide, which for a small busted woman is significant. The area has remained painful all day. I fully recognise that in comparison to getting another breast cancer this is a minor discomfort, but I've never before been left bruised like this in the nearly 23 years of regular screening. I was left wondering whether this bruising was due to a more comprehensive screening by this Health Care worker or whether they could have provided effective screening without this unusually great pain or whether it is a characteristic of the new machine. So, can the trauma be reduced without compromising the screening? "
4278,As last time all the staff are so helpful and friendly.

4249,"Astonishing lack of empathy from, in particular, the reception staff in the A&E department l, when it is needed the most. Fell forward at speed and my teeth went through my lip, pharmacist said it was infected and urged me to go to the hospital. Which I wanted to avoid specifically because my experiences at this hospital have never been good. I was in a really bad way and had been waiting at a far busier hospital 5 hours previous. They lost the appointment made by 111 twice and couldn't care less. I know they're busy but there is no excuse for the lack of care or empathy shown in this setting. Tl;DR Complete lack of care, complete lack of empathy, A & E is cramped and hygiene levels could be better."

3231,St James ward j46 and j47 - I was admitted to hospital in June 2021 with acute pancreatitis and liver issues due to gall stones. I was very ill and in a lot of pain. It took five days to find a painkiller that worked for me. I was in both wards as had to be isolated for a few days due to stomach issues. I ended up having my gall bladder removed. I cannot fault anyone who was there the entire time I was in there. I felt safe and cared for the entire time I was there. Every single member of the staff who worked in there went above and beyond. In my opinion they are all angels. The wards were spotlessly clean. The food was perfectly fine and some of the soups were amazing. Thank you for looking after me so well. You made a very bad time so much easier to bear. Once I can drive again I will be dropping off something to say thank you.

I'm extremely pleased with the top-notch care I received from the Gynaecologist and the nursing team during my short stay at the Hysteroscopy Unit on 10th July 2020.

Thank you for your patience, professionalism, kindness, and commitment to excellent medical care rendered to me during the procedure . I'm proud of the nursing team .I'm exceedingly satisfied with your professionalism and commitment to excellent nursing care. Thank you all for everything."
3386,"22 month wait for gallbladder operation (still waiting) - In April 2018 I developed very unpleasant and persistent nausea. After a series of blood tests it was revealed in August that I had Hepatitis C. I assumed that this was causing the nausea. I couldn't get an appointment to see the specialist at the Gastroenterology Unit till December: treatment for the Hepatitis would start in the New Year. I felt very relieved. But some blood test results were lost and I didn't start the course until March. A routine blood test as part of the Hepatitis treatment revealed gallstones. All went well with the course, until two months later I told the nurse (who up to then had been great) that the nausea was still troubling me. They told me that this was a completely separate issue. I asked for it to be looked at, but was discharged back to my GP. Another two week wait, more blood tests; In August my GP referred me back to the Gastro unit urgently for the gallstones to be looked at. They were astonished I had been discharged. I wasn't given an appointment until December. During this time my nausea was getting slowly worse until in November I had horrible sickness and couldn't get out of bed. The GP sent me straight to A&E as an erupting gallstone can be very serious, even lethal. The staff on Juniper Ward were great, until four days later the surgical junior who discharged me told me I needed an urgent endoscopy. They tried to be helpful but didn't seem clear as to the date. They finally promised I was booked in for a Tuesday two weeks later. By the Monday afternoon I had not heard a word and had to go back to the ward and stand there, interrupting people, which I didn't like doing, to find out what was going on. It turned out that the specialist was on holiday that week, so why I was led to believe I would be treated then I don't know. When I was booked in two weeks after that, the surgeon couldn't access my gallbladder because of my hernia. I don't blame anyone for that. My notes were handed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital where a full surgical op was booked in for early February this year. This was cancelled. I'm now in position where I get sick very easily, (I've been off work this week with the nausea), not knowing whether I should check into A & E, not knowing how much longer I have to wait. It's very worrying and upsetting and I can't make any plans. I feel my concerns about the nausea were ignored. Although I of course understood that treating the Hep C was a priority nobody seemed interested in what my own priorities were. I have been given no detailed advice on diet. This has been going on for nearly two years. To say I'm fed up is an understatement."

I could not find a map on the website showing the disabled parking bays, in fact the parking department did not seem to appear anywhere that I could see. "

The ambulance crew were excellent, and reassured us, they called a senior paramedic as my grandfather refused to go into hospital. The paramedic gave him a very thorough check over, and although he wanted my grandfather to hospital but wouldn't force him. The paramedic then had a long telephone conversation with a doctor to make sure things were ok. The crew stayed with us until they were sure he was stable. I would just like to say a big thank you to the three lads who came out, they really made us all feel more relaxed. This is a cracking service, and such a good thing we have them. Well done. "

3416,"I dont normally post stuff like this but I think people should be aware just how disgraceful the hospital is. So.. I was admitted to Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust a week ago today for vomiting, unable to keep down foods and fluids and severe weight loss which took my weight down to 45 kilograms. My vomiting started on Boxing Day last year and I had already attempted a&e 3 times before they actually decided to admit me last week. While in the hospital, I endur...ed a endoscopy (camera down my throat into my stomach) and I was told that the gastrointestinal team would be coming to see me to: 1. Give me my results of the endoscopy 2. Be put on a feeding tube to start the process of getting my weight and appetite back slowly 3. Put me on the gastrointestinal ward so that I had specialists there to support me with my vomiting. 4. Come up with a plan on how I can move forward with my life after everything has just been put on hold for 5 months Today I have discharged myself due to all of this information I was told, being a lie. They weren't going to give me my endoscopy results, they refused to give me a feeding tube (despite it being highly recommended by my dietician and requested for multiple times by myself) . And the gastrointestinal doctors refused to come and see me and give me any answers. To top it all off, they have lied on my medication charts and signed for medications that I did not receive and they also filled out my food charts with false information to make it seem as thought I've been making improvements. I have been sat in there for a week, lonely, missing my family and deteriorating not just physically but also mentally with no help or support from the doctors whatsoever. . Last week I was brought a meal and I requested my anti sickness medication and explained to the nurse that I was unable to eat my meal until I'd had my anti sickness medication to which her response was ‚Äúwell don't eat then‚Äù, when I began to cry because I felt helpless, her next words were ‚ÄúI think you should just go outside‚Äù and then continued to leave me there with no help. . This hospital has failed me greatly and I will now be trying to find a road to recovery by myself with my family."

3876,"Urgent Treatment Centre - Embarrassment to the NHS - A lot of the reviews here echo my own. So I won't repeat them however I'll explain my individual situation and why this resulted in a 1 star review. 5 days ago I had major surgery and am still recovering. Today I started experiencing palpitations, shortness of breath and chest pain. NHS 111 told me to go to A&E, and I did so although naturally did not want to. I'd have enough of hospitals. Following major surgery you experience a lot of pain, when I arrived my pain medication was working. But a couple of hours into my wait it came back and I was not only dealing with the new chest pain, I was suffering in pain from the incisions and trauma my body underwent in surgery. I've now been waiting for over 4 hours, and despite having requested medication from two nurses and a doctor directly, I am still sitting in pain with 0 communication on when they may be able to offer me some. I am not angry about the wait, I am not angry about the lack of communication from staff. I am angry that the staff are not managing patient pain while they wait, some here have been waiting for 7 hours. I'd hate to find out they are also dealing with unmanaged pain. When I spoke to the Nurses they said they'd pass it onto the doctor. With no luck on that front I asked a doctor directly. 1 hour later, still no pain relief. This poor patient care is not only an embarrassment to the NHS, it's an embarrassment to our nation. How can we call ourselves one of the best healthcare systems in the world, say the NHS is one of the best employers in the world‚Ä¶ when patients are left in agony for hours on end despite approaching staff in a kindly manor. Maybe one has to be bleeding all over the floor before someone offers you some paracetamol."
3508,"Worst place I've ever been and, for the record, I was once stuck on a mountain for 3-4 hours. The best thing they do is keep you waiting until you give up and then be very careful not to have an accident so you don't come here again for the rest of your life."

However I didn't like the fact that my appointment was at 11 am and when I joined the queue there were others there who'd had a phone call to come in earlier for their vaccine which meant that there was a longer wait time and someone else took my appointment.

7578,"Cognitive Awareness Classes - My husband was reluctant to attend cognitive awareness classes at first but eventually came to quite enjoy them. I think he thought that the other members of the group were affected by their dementia and that he wasn't and he, therefore, enjoyed talking to the staff and was sure that he was having a normal conversation. He was also very proud of the fact that he could get to the classes by himself on the local bus. I wish now that there was some part of follow on actually at the same venue, i.e. perhaps a memory cafe, because if he believed that it was part of his treatment he would still attend.

7761,"Hello, Excellent well organised hospitaI. I was in the coronary care unit for three days after they called out an emergency team at 22:00. Nothing was too much trouble for the dedicated, caring and attentive staff. From consultants to tea ladies i was treated with courtesy and respect. They explained in detail what they were doing and answered any questions, all with a sense of humour. Particular thanks to Sophie and Debbie."

4426,Light bright and airy. Inside fantastic. Had to look about for entrance to visitor's car park though so signage there could be better. Far superior to Sunderland Royal - much cleaner. Lovely staff. Enjoyed looking at the displayed surgical and medical equipment of years ago. How things have changed.

5137,"Was advised to attend Princess Royal University Hospital A&E department after a phone call with 111. I was advised to check in at 18:20pm. I had swelling to the left leg, knee and ankle and a increased heart rate of 130BPM, along with this I was dizzy and was unable to control my breathing due to an increased heart rate. When I arrived for my assessment the nurse checked my blood pressure- the first time this was done the Velcro popped off as it was so tight, the 2nd one she used was so tight I nearly collapsed, I was in severe pain and distress as my blood circulation was temporarily cut off in my lower arm, after taking it off, I was left with bruising on the skin and internal damage to my arm where I was unable to move it and was in excruciating pain. After waiting 2 hours to see a doctor, I was disgusted with the service provided, he did not know why I was there, did not understand any of my symptoms and was unable to give me any kind of indication to what was causing me so much distress.I informed him I had a specialist appointment within the coming weeks but my symptoms had intensified and I could not wait until this appointment. The doctor however; informed me to wait till my appointment and could not give me any kind of help or answers as to why I was experiencing multiple symptoms- mainly being my increased heart rate and the excruciating pain I was in from my leg which was swollen and had resulted in me not being able to walk. The doctor did not want to know and sent me away. When I arrived home I noticed I had bruising to my arm from the blood pressure machine being unbearably tight and leaving it numb with pins and needles. After being fobbed off from the A&E department, plus leaving with further injury I was furious. I will never be attending this hospital again, the service I received was a joke, this ‚Äòdoctor' had no idea in what he was doing. Absolutely disgusting behaviour and service received. They are lucky I am not taking out a claim for the injury of my arm."
9966,1 very good | Very professional as always. Explained what was wrong and put me on the right track.
2150,"Excellent and efficient service this morning. I was surprised to see large queues outside before opening, but everything moved quickly once open. A well thought out waiting system, the chairs in the waiting room cleaned after every patient and a quick and painless experience. Well done all üëèüëèüëè you're doing a great job! "
7380,"Always treated very well - I have had treatment at NDDH over the last three years for various eye conditions, including injections for myopic CNV and cataract surgery in both eyes. I have therefore had a lot of appointments. Throughout I have found staff to be friendly, professional, flexible and humane. They have always treated me very well with some examples of really exceptional care, despite being very busy. I am so grateful for all the care I have had. Thank you so much! "
4014,Terrible wait at least 6 hours. Very rude staff!!! Tell me to sit instead of explain how mach we need to wait. Terrible experience. These are not professionals at all! Would not recommend!!!

1092,Emergency Abdominal Surgery - Brilliant treatment and care - I had an emergency operation to repair an incarcerated hernia and was in hospital for 5 days on Ward 12. The medical care throughout was outstanding. Particularly at the moment the staff are being pushed to their limits but they still provided great support to me and I am so very grateful to them.

Everybody without exception contributed to a great experience. Despite the difficult times we are facing, teams like this more in front line than many, experience felt far from production line imagined, personal, positive and kind, everyone bright and cheerful, reassuring for all attending.

1300,"Diagnostic Endoscopy - Great all round - I had a colonscopy. Everyone was so helpful from the moment I entered. Staff stopped to show the way.All procedures were clearly explained with only one exception. Prior to admission I should have been made aware that paracetamol should not be taken within 6 hours of the procedure. The published leaflet did not make this clear but I was outside the timescale. I was as comfortable as possible during the procedure, able to follow clearly by watching on screen. Everyone was relaxed and friendly. The debriefing was clearand I left with the impression of a department which although busy put the patient clearly first. Thank you"
9,"Waiting time - Sick people go there and have to wait there well over an hour is ridiculous, why book appointment for 12. 30 for that many people at the same time when only 2 doctors on site. I think with their own time they should respect patients time too, waiting hours doesn't help when u aren't feeling well in the first place."
2929,Everyone was kind and reassuring.
3661,"Thank you @OUHospitals. Our general practitioner told me to take our child to the Emergency Department at the John Radcliffe Hospital. A wonderful, empathic nurse (and later, consultant) treated him and everything is okay. Thank goodness for the @NHS. /1 https://t.co / YMxnBfrMAy"
5301,"Staff and doctors are great but waiting time in A&E is too much. My mum went to a&E as she was feeling really unwell and we had to call an ambulance but she had to wait 6-7 hours to be seen by a doctor. I don't think this is reasonable time for an old patient who was feeling really unwell, plus they don't allow anyone else in with the patient which made us super worried."
7679,Fantastic people here.
8586,"Maternity services - First Class Maternity Service - I went to the MAU for what I thought would be a quick check up after becoming quite swollen. It was mainly for peace of mind and reassurance but I was very quickly diagnosed with severe pre eclampsia and I was admitted to the Delivery Suite for one to one monitoring. I was kept in over night but unfortunately my blood pressure could not be stabilised and my baby girl was born the following day by emergency C Section at only 31 weeks gestation and a tiny 2lb 4oz. My daughter went on to spend 6 weeks in the Neo Natal Unit and is now home and thriving. I am extremely greatful to the midwives, doctors and consultants on the MAU and Delivery Suite for their quick diagnosis, care and professionalism. Without their expertises my babies life could have been at grave risk and I feel so thankful and lucky to the staff that I have my beautiful baby daughter. I don't think it is possible to get better health care than what I received on the MAU and Delivery Suite and I would particularly like the midwives who looked after me on the Delivery Suite to have some recognition. I cannot recommend or praise the maternity care I received highly enough their quick intervention saved my babies life words can not express how thankful I am. "

No-one appears to be waiting for a very long time, staff are really helpful and friendly and take time to ensure they cover everything! It doesn't feel rushed! When I went for an X-ray with my son we were in and out in minutes! Also Parking is very good! Compared to the parking shambles / ruin / continued joke that is City and Queens the parking is in abundance and it is often very easy to get a space near the entrance. Brilliant, what a relief it is to have this fantastic hospital nearby in the community to utilise in the event of any issues! "

3524,"Hospitals fine. Clean, tidy appointment on time etc. Car parks expensive if you can find a spot. Paying is not a easy experience. Considering it's a hospital and the health of the nation etc etc why are patients subjected to frustration, high levels of stress and unnecessary anxiety trying to pay to park never mind finding a spot. I resulted in using a side street and walking in after 20mins of driving around. Why isn't parking free to make peoples life so much easier. It is a hospital after all."

3571,The staff were perfect from AE to assessment to ward staff there work hard and very professional
7184,"The gratitude I have for all the staff at Musgrove for saving my baby.. - Our baby was delivered via c section at 30 weeks with severe intrauterine growth restriction (IGUR) weighing only 830grams. Our world was turned completely upside down and the emotions we felt were unimaginable. The staff within the neonatal intensive care unit at Musgrove were amazing, not only did they care for our little miracle with so much love and affection but they were a great support to us too. This continued for the 8 long weeks that we stayed at the unit. With another child at home and my husband having to return to work after 2 weeks I could not always be in the unit with my baby which was the most unnatural feeling in the world. It broke me everyday that I had to walk out and leave him but the wonderful staff always reassured me, they sent me photos and videos and answered my many phone calls! There are no words to describe the gratitude I have for all the staff at Musgrove for saving my baby, working so hard with him so that he was able to come home, without them it would have been very different. I will forever be in their debt and from the bottom of my heart I cannot thank them enough."

She removed part of a big toenail which had gone black, and was partly loose, very skillfully and gave me good advice as to how to proceed. The lady was very nice and her service was excellent. I have been to the minor injuries department a few times and have always had good service from your hospital. Well done."

8485,"Accident and emergency services - Amazing care - Having fallen down stairs I arrived at A&E early evening, my husband could not accompany due to the pandemic, I was seen straight away and taken to Trauma, the individuals who attended myself throughout the evening were all so kind, attentive and had my safety and well being as paramount, some of the cases they see and abuse they put up with is unbearable when these people give their lives and souls to care for us, I felt so safe I just want to say thank you you are all amazing "

6975,"Going there is really waste of time, the receptionist was an old lady and she was not really nice with some people, I can say she was racist. The nurse was very good mannered lady. The doctor in the centre was not really helpful."
1016,"I saw a very kind, considerate and thorough Locum Consultant. It couldnt have been any better."
6203,Breast cancer services - Empathic staff - The experience of a first mammogram and other related screening tests can be very frightening. Once the staff realised my concerns they treated me very emphatically and sensitively. All procedures were carried out professionally and in a caring manner. Thank you to the amazing breast screening team!

4336,Don't know - Incompetent ultra sound - My 80 year old mum had to wait one and a half hours in chronic pain for an ultra sound. She was sent at 1pm from. Outpatients for a scan which was supposed to be at 2pm. She was in so much pain but the scan department decided to see her at 3.35pm even the doctor was surprised and came to see what was taking so long. We have had a right rubbish treatment here at imaging. I would give them 0 percent for everything 
8439,One of my most traumatic experiences has to be the time the nurse at the Whittington hospital snapped my broken pinky finger back in place while I was awake
1491,Nightmare for parking.. disabled have to pay more than before they changed the way of paying.... some of the departments are great very nice friendly staff... others are rude and dont listen at all... if I could afford I'd pay to go private...

3979,Nothing but praise for staff and hospital kept me informed about my operation very kind and helpful unfortunately will see you soon for my other procedures
8480,"Rude staff members - I had spinal surgery and needed a district nurse to change my dressing and they said I wouldn't be able to have a district nurse come to my house to change my dressing because I had been in hospital and because I wasn't housebound, even though I had major spinal surgery and had difficulty walking. After a complaint to the surgery they said they would get a urgent referral to the district nurse, which should take 24 -48 hours and it didn't get picked up because the secretary was off work. I would not recommend this surgery. I felt that the reception staff were rude and have no people skills. I am not very happy at all."

6192,"Very professional Dental Department - Molar Tooth extraction with long roots. Was kept informed all the way through. All options discussed initially. The process itself was virtually painless and very skillfully handled. Was nervous as to what to expect, but I needed have worried."
6633,"We had our baby in this hospital in June. Although there was a delay to break my waters, everything after that was really quick. I had a lovely midwife who was great throughout my Labour and heard all my concerns and delivered the best she could. I could not ask for anymore then I got. Even in the wards, I met a midwife who really took care of me. I would just like to let everyone know, that it's not their fault if there is some sort of delay, as there can be emergencies, so be patient. Once they start your process, you will be their priority and they will always look after you extremely well. I would happily recommend this hospital to all mothers-to-be."
5449,"Absolutely Disgraceful! - I Have Been with CAMHS now for about a year! Im Still no better. First off they put me on an antidepressant called fluoxetine and it wasn't working for me so I was Promised that this, 'Happy medicine' as my Doctor Calls it, will start to make me feel a whole lot better. It Didn't do nothing for me and i had been taking it for about 3 & 1/2Months. My Doctor then promised me that he'd Put my dose up but didn't. Im Now on sertraline and have been for around 10 weeks. No Relief at all. I was told that my dose was going to be upped and it hasn't! I'm absolutely disgusted with this service and I think that they should be a lot nicer. I am still waiting for a call from my doctor from 2 week ago. It feels as if they don't care one bit! In My opinion, this service should be reviewed and the staff should have to go through training again. I'm Not saying any of this in a nasty way but its actually quite a bad service. The only good thing they have done is got me a diagnosis which isn't really good but its better knowing what's wrong with me, not that I didn't anyways but yeah. They should know how to treat it and know that my tablets aren't working. Its best to stick with your GP to be fair, they do a hell of a lot more."
8617,Fast professional service.
4625,"When I have been an in patient before every thing has been excellent. This time not so good. The nursing staff were overall very kind and caring, however I never did get a name band put in on my entire stay. Also a nurse came to take blood sugars and just as she going to take it I told I had never had the done before. She then went off and checked and had made a mistake. The cleaning of the room left a lot to be desired. When I went into my room and there was dried blood on the bed table and in the end I cleaned it up. My room never got cleaned until the Friday and I had been there since Wednesday."

6084,"Dermatology - Poor care and consultation - For the past year the department has been treating me and not once has the department fully answered my questions, successfully satisfied my concerns or even had basic respect to let me speak and raise my concerns and queries but have repeatedly cut me off from speaking. I can understand this is a difficult time for us all but some have taken it as an excuse to neglect patients. They haven't been keeping me informed I'm due time, they've been constantly changing appointment dates without no reason or notice and have been doing it to the point where they've ended up going back to the original date of appointment. An example of this was when they moved my phone call appointment to a couple months ahead and when I called to raise a concern with them they cut my call, didn't answer to the voicemails or constant calls and when I did get a hold of them they said they'll call on the day which my appointment was originally scheduled which doesn't make any sense. I can understand there's a back log and that you have a lot of patients but a simple basic human respect and concern should be upheld as well and I'm sorry to say certain members of this department have not presented that and I'm sorry for the members who don't categorise in this. Patients have deep concerns regarding their health and some members haven't answered their queries, concerns and worries but instead have just delivered a summary and not answered in detail when asked about it. Completely appalling"

She kept nipping in to check on her and made her smile. There was also a member of admin called Gwen that was also really good with Karen, when Karen told her it was my birthday she came back on the phone and sang happy birthday to me which was really sweet of her. They finally allowed Karen to come home after been in hospital for nearly 4 weeks.

When I arrived, I had very little wait. My dentist was absolutely stellar and helped put me at ease. I am so grateful for the care I've received so far. Thank you! "
7518,I am missing home but most staff take the time to chat and that makes me feel better 
3264,Had the most amazing meal from the new Barista in the Park @AlderHey. I couldn't decide which meal I wanted so had the chunky chilli for lunch (divine doesn't cover it!). I also got the vegetarian homemade samosa and onion bhaji which I've had for my tea... utterly amazing.

879,1Professional HelpfulKind and doing a great job.  Just keep trucking along!And a big Thanks!
7249,The eating disorder clinic in my opinion is not fit for purpose. This clinic had made me never want to go into another eating disorder clinic again. The experience was that bad. If you're looking for compassion and to be diagnosed correctly I recommend you find another place. They don't even look out for food restrictive disorder. Rude passive aggressive and in my opinion shouldn't be working with vulnerable people.
2591,I was seen to very quickly and the nurse was amazing and friendly
9256,"Rude receptionists - I've been using this clinic for years and never have I encountered a helpful receptionist. They are rude, patronising, and passive aggressive. The medical staff, however, are extremely friendly and helpful. "

6766,"Obstetrics And Gynaecology - GAU Team You ticked all the 6 Cs - A big thank you On the 23.02.2020 late shift and night. I came in with severe pain being escorted escorted by a total stranger. To that stranger thank you. To the team: You were empathetic, you respected me, involved me in the care you were providing despite the fact that at the time I was not even paying attention. But you created the time to come back to me to ensure that I am part of the care you are providing. you were caring, quick to respond and to act. Please keep-up the good JOB. "

9350,"First time in James Cook Accident and emergency far too small but all staff very nice Admission to ward 37 the Care provided for me and what I saw of others is second to none. For 3 days I watched the staff show so much patience, time empathy. Every one went above and beyond. No one realises how they go the extra mile never leave on time and take all the time they need never did I experience being rushed. All the nurses and Health Care Assistances were amazing especially with the older people.I have to make a special thank you to the 2 doctors who carried out the lumbar puncture as I was extremely scared they were very respectful and the communication all through the process was just great and I cannot thank them enough for the support and care. My only poor experience was the only rough health care assistance who at about 330am carried out covid test told me it would be painful but she shoved the stick so far up I screamed and grabbed her arm she rudely told me don't do that, she shown no feeling it was a job to do. My nose poured with lots blood for over 5 mins. The lovely nurse who sat there who was filling in paperwork didn't say anything but I could tell by her face it wasn't right. I witnessed at least 3 covid tests carried out by other HCA and this didn't happen to any other patient. I spoke to 3 nurses during my stay each one told me when they hit resistance they should stop she didn't. This has made me terrified of this procedure. It's a shame as my experience was exceptional apart from this I didn't see her after that thank goodness."
9169,"The process was clear and efficient and the meeting with the consultant was calm, factual and very reassuring. A meeting I was very nervous about turned out to be one that gave me confidence and clarity. Very impressed and grateful."
6457,"I've just phoned crisis line and want to complain! There is only one person at the end of the line, as I rang 2X.first time she could not understand my name which I spelt out for her twice, so I phoned back hoping to get another person. There is only one person there so when I asked her surname..she said you want my surname and you won't give me yours! Not constructive and basically WRONG! She could not listen and take my surname and believe me, my diction is clear, therefore her response was almost aggressive. Will put complaint in writing. The other night, I spoke to Holly on 2nd January and she was really helpful so seems it's the luck of the draw whether your call is responded to successfully"
983,"No information - My Father was admitted to AAU last week. Since then he has been moved 4 times. He has dementia and is very confused. He finally landed up on Croxley ward. The staff on there are quite rude and dont give us any information on my fathers condition. That is when we eventually get them to answer the phone. I must say AAU are brilliant but once a patient goes on to a ward the standard of care seems to drop dramatically. I appreciate that you are busy but we had no contact with my Dad for 2 days. And the practice of facetime, which means we have to have Apple products is not fair to people that have Android phones"

I was diagnosed with acute appendicitis, however to everyone in casualty, both wards 6 and 9. X-ray, porters,, kitchen, theatre and recovery. The treatment I received was exceptional, the commitment you give with a smile working the hours you do. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for looking after me so well."
1736,i would recommend the ambulance service usually they are all brilliant. except for last night after a paramedic failed to book my 8 month old prem baby in after she had rolled off our bed and banged her head. we was left sat in the waiting area for hours and nobody even knew we was there because they didnt do the handover! when i confronted doctors at the hospital why i was still sat waiting after numerous children was in and out being seen my daughter had no obs done or any...thing the whole time we were there waiting because they were all completely unaware we was there and had to retake our details... not to mention the paramedic was falling asleep in the back of the ambulance on the way to the hospital.... all paramedics do an amazing job but last night couldve easily been avoided if anything wouldve happened to my daughter those paramedics wouldve been held responsible!

331,Sedation for Endoscopy - Was in Endoscopy Unit at Pilgrim Hospital for the third visit in four months. Difficult procedure as I have sigmoid loops in my gut. my previous appointment was not a happy experience as the consultant struggled and I was in a lot of pain took days to get over it. I was however worried about the recent procedure as I felt I needed more sedation because of my condition I explained why and hoped for the best. but they listened and could not have been more helpful promising that my concerns would be dealt with. Day of procedure they were thorough in preparation making sure the consultant knew that there might be problems and extra sedation was needed. While the procedure was not exactly pain free the nursing staff were so kind and caring and that got me through the procedure. Results were good and I am more than pleased with the staff at Pilgrim Endoscopy Unit they could not have done more.
1418,All staff polite and helpful

2162,"Accident and emergency services - No patient centred therapy. - I visited A&E department with relative. Some staff employed there is rude, there is no patient centred therapy at all, and you cannot explain that by being busy. There are often talking over you rather than with you. You feel like they are giving you favour even talking to you. There is no empathy at all. When you ask reception question how long is the waiting, you are quickly fobbed off with not long but when you ask how long is that POLITELY (you may just want to know true if is 2 hours, 3 hours or 30 min) straight away you treated as you have problem. I would advice they should rotate every 6 months to different departments to not too loose passion for work. And I'm talking about reception as well as there are first point of contact. After, my relative was admitted to ward which was completely different story and staff was very helpful, polite and nice and I can't say anything wrong about care there. It was like completely different hospital. A&E I wouldn't recommend to anyone."
9920,"Very quick waiting time and excellent care, in an out in less then an hour, fantastic"

For such a long time I have suffered but have been patient because of the current situation, now I am left to just deal with it and walk it off (impossible as the worst pain I suffer is when mobile). I came out of the hospital today so upset and disappointed. Perhaps it's time to see my GP again and get a referral to a different hospital."

I want a refund on all the national insurance I have paid to a corrupt nhs whilst it is privatised by stealth to line the pockets of big pharma."

Hi ‚Äì now that I'm back home, and continuing the recovery process, I just wanted to take some time to offer my feedback on my experience during my time in the hospital. In summary‚Ä¶..Absolutely Brilliant! I have nothing but praise for all the staff I came into contact with, the overall conditions, the food and the quality of the care I received. I have so many people to thank for making my time in the RUH such a pleasurable experience. Unfortunately, I can't recall all their individual names - but you will know who they are. I have to thank: The massive team of staff involved with the running of Philip Yeoman Ward where I stayed. Every single one of them was friendly, happy, professional and caring. Nothing was too much trouble for them and, as a group, they contributed massively to my overall (and extremely positive) experience. My surgeon, and his team for their skills and abilities during the actual op'. The anaesthesia team for making what, for me, was probably the most worrying part of the op' so worry-free and safe. The team in Post-Op Recovery. The Physio's and Occupational Therapy staff for their assistance Post ‚ÄòOp. We hear so much these days about the state of the NHS and it's (negative) impact on the quality of care that patients receive. From my experience I cannot find fault with any aspect of the service and just wanted to let you know that. Unfortunately, I didn't have the chance to thank everyone involved with my stay so would really appreciate it if, somehow, you could feed this back to them. Thanks again. Kev Beilby. "
5143,Therapist very clear and communicative. Excellent advice and exercise programme
6815,"Booked but overrunning by one hour - I took a great deal of trouble to book a convenient appointment. When I got there the person directing traffic was directing traffic to areas where cars parked when there were spaces available where she had not checked. We were then told to queue on a ramp, making it difficult for disabled people coming back down the ramp by wheelchair, then informed they were, unbelievably one hour behind, herded into several waiting rooms to wait until vaccinated. Next time I won't be using this surreal and frankly lunatic service, which wasn't patient friendly."
6149,"Medical ambulance arrived well in time. Ambulance team was very knowledgeable and helpful. In the hospital, A&E staff, Doctor, nurses were very knowledgeable and helpful. They took quick action. They kept my son Mohammed under observation and when they felt confident that nothing serious, they allowed us to go to home with medication. Dr. explained everything in simple and understandable words. Thank you all the RSCH staff. You are excellent!"

2557,"This is about my left eye - Due to an eye injury the pressure in my left eye rose to a critical level, in 2019 I had surgery to alleviate the problem. The operation performed was a Trabeculectomy, a delicate operation, but routine. The operation did alleviate the pressure but unfortunately during the procedure something went wrong behind the eye causing a bleed, an Edema. I was then transferred to a different consultant for solutions. To remedy this new problem, every 4 weeks, I had injections directly into my eye, this was 3 times over approximately 3 months, the fluid injected into my eye was called Avastin, this procedure was relatively painless After further investigation it was evident the Avastin did not work. I was told I would have to have 3 further 4 weekly injections, this time behind the eye. This treatment however was not just behind the eye but entailed eye drops then a painkiller injected into the corner area of my eye socket and then the injection behind the eye, the treatment was called Posterior Subtenon Triamcinolone, I have yet to find out if this treatment has been successful. With all the Avastin injections, performed by a team member of the consultant, the worst side effects was a bloodshot eye. The Triamcinolone injections were performed by the consultant, the first 2 times were uncomfortable but not to painful, it left me with bruising on the eyelid which lasted about 5 days. The last injection has left me very badly bruised, my eye is bloodshot, I am totally black around the eye socket and spreading and my nose is black. It is now a week since the operation and there is no sign of healing. It seems to me that the reason for my bruising is that the consultant was running late, had a lousy cold and during the procedure I could feel they were heavy handed, certainly not delicate or gentile like the previous 2 procedures performed on me. I am hoping the surgery has been successful otherwise I have been beaten up for nothing."

4607,Accident and emergency services - Fantastic staff - I visted the childrens A&E department with my daughter after being advised to by 111. The staff at the department were absolutely fantastic. They made me feel supported whilst making sure that my daughter was comfortable. This included giving her an icepop to make sure she stayed hydrated. We were seen quickly by a nurse who listened to me and took time when checking my daughter out. We didn't have to wait long to see a doctor who was very friendly and spoke to both my daughter and i in a very caring manner. The department itself was clean and welcoming. Cannot fault the staff or the childrens A&E department at all. They made a worrying situation a little easier to deal with. Huge thanks to everyone involved at this wonderful hospital.

2387,"failure to refer me on to orthopaedic department - I attended Urology clinic back in August 2019, and at the time I informed the Dr that I was getting worsening numbness in left foot, coupled with worsening incontinence. At the time they have also been aware of my previous spinal surgery on the L4/5 disc, and previous spinal related history. My last surgery was at Gatwick Park Hospital just over 3 years ago, when the numbness in the foot improved considerably post op and the incontinence was to a large extent resolved, However in the past 4 months the numbness in the left foot and incontinence have become very challenging to manage, and since my appointment last August, nothing appears to have happened re spinal review / referral. I would be very grateful if this could be rectified with either a further review either virtually / face to face asap. I am finding the increasing incontinence very humiliating, and challenging at times."
2055,"Accident and emergency services - Excellent treatment - On Friday 6th Dec I had cause to call 111 and after being assessed by the operator she decided it would be necessary to get an ambulance to me but if my symptoms worsened to call 999 as they would be aware of my situation. In fact a para medic arrived an proceeded to take ops and did an ecg and decided it was best to take me to Colchester General. On arrival I was taken straight to the treatment area and my ops were taken again immediately. I also had blood tests, another ecg and x-rays. Plus was seen by a doctor both before results of tests and after. I cannot praise the medical staff I came into contact with highly enough and wish to express my grateful thanks for the excellent treatment I received. The care and kindness shown was exceptional considering the pressure they are all working under. They are a credit to Colchester General and the NHS. Many thanks. Maggie"
2135,Intensive Care - Covid 19 - My husband was rushed in quite ill with covid he was put in HDU because of breathing problems. I cannot fault the care he has had over the last few days as he is now covid free on very low oxygen so no longer needs to be in HDU. They now keep telling him there are no beds so he is stuck there. This is now getting him very down & worried he is going to get ill with the stress. I can't believe there are no free beds in the whole of ES hospital?

You will understand then that I have spent many months (over a period of time) and I only have praise for all the hospital staff. From the consultants to the cleaning staff. Today however I met a nurse, This lady gave a new meaning to nursing. I had just had enema and was as you may imagine in a bit of a mess. the nurse was exceptionally kind and understanding and put me completely at ease, she showered me, dried me and helped me into pyjamas. All the smiling laughing and taking my mind off an embarrassing situation. I was so taken with her kindness and understanding I felt I needed to tell you. She is in my opinion a first class nurse who deserves recognition."

4594,"General Medicine - Pharmacy staff are absolutly rubbish and rude - The nurses and doctors of this hospital are very good and always take good care of thier patients. The pharmacy staff however are atrocious the waiting time for 1 prescription is outrageous, the staff are I'll mannered and have no respect the lady told me I could take my prescription and go elsewhere when I asked how long I would have to wait. Later I send my husband to collect my medicine because the wait time was too long and they gave him the only part of my medication!! So we have to pay another visit to collect the rest of the medication again. They never answer the phone so there is no way of contacting them. They need to train their staff to be more polite and respectful, patients are waiting 40+ minutes for medication they are bound to get annoyed. "
3539,"Don't know - Amazing staff all round, especially Daisy Unit - I was kept in overnight on the 9th July after gallbladder surgery, I would like to say a big thank you to all involved, particularly the day and night staff in the Daisy Unit.

We were advised their was a minimum of a 6 hour wait, the waiting are was cramped and clearly the idea of social distancing was not feasible due to the numbers waiting for attention- it struck me as odd our horse had the attention of a trained equine medical professional within an hour of the incident, my daughter faced a 6 hour wait for the same level of attention. This is not a criticism of the staff who do an excellent job in clearly very difficult Circumstances, this is meant As a wake up call for the hospital managers- take a long hard look at the design of the dept, redesign the area to give the staff and patients the best possible option your current environment is not fit for purpose."
9035,I received amazing treatment from start to finish from the paramedics doctors nurses HCAs and porters. I was treated with respect and dignity even tho I was in a vulnerable position if you could please pass on my gratitude to every one involved in my care that would be much appreciated
1309,Always very friendly and helpful
9635,2 the sanitisation very bad in the hospital nothing on entering the hospital entrance | The sanitisation for a hospital very poor especially at the entrance and on chairs in eye unit

4606,"I can not express how bad this so called hospital is. They have a patient experience team, The arrogance of it.

5651,"The negligence and mis-treatment of my 95 year old Grandmother whilst in the care of the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth contributed greatly to her death. When I visited unannounced on several occasions, she was surrounded with loads of dirty used gowns and I even witnessed that she wasn't offered a fresh gown for hours, until she asked. I will never recommend this hospital again! "
3896,"Very polite and kind staff. Explained everything, very well."
4268,Best hospital in the UK.
1665,every single member of the nhs was helpful and courteous from beginning to end there support is amazing
3809,Accident and emergency services - Seem to bundle everyone in the waiting room! - I've had two 7 hour wait in A&E recently. On both occasions I was stuck in the waiting room with no social distancing and at times no where to sit. There seemed to be limited care for patients; I felt really unwell after a blood test but got told to go back to the waiting room and I was given a sick bucket. Which wouldn't of been nice for other people in the waiting room to see me being sick. There was no patient privacy as there was people coming to reception explaining their issues. Also doctors coming out to patients and you could hear everything that was being said. The seats were also uncomfortable to sit for long periods and no vending machines nearby to get drink and snacks. 
2535,"found out today that the appointment for my husband has been rejected by a consultant and referred back to the GP, how is this supporting my husband????? where is our right to a consultation???? disgusting"

7129,Cannot fault the ward. All staff are helpful and know that anything I need the staff will be straight there. | Nothing at all
3905,"Quite the worst hospital. Shameful A and E department. An utter disgrace to The NHS. Rude, unhelpful, demoralised, lazy staff. Disfunctional and disordered. Pointless and uninformed waiting around. Absolutely clueless employees. Needs to rebuild and reorganise from scratch. Dreadful experience. Go somewhere else or live with your pain, like I did. I wished I was in any other country when I had need to be there. Would have been better looked after virtually anywhere in the world. Truly shocking. Makes, much criticised, Reading A & E seem beyond reproach. Sack the C.E.O. of Bristol Royal Infirmary. Appalling failure after being in that job so long. The Care Quality Commission gave it Outstanding. Yes; Outstandingly Awful."
9480,Some staff are unbelievably lazy. I wonder they become lazy because of their role or have been over applaused! 
7883,"Loving, caring team - I was on the SSSWard at Heatherwood Hospital on Monday 28th June for breast surgery. From the moment I arrived, my overnight stay, right through to the moment I was able to go home, the staff were so loving and caring. It was my first hospital experience and I feel so blessed to have been looked after by such superb staff who were kind, gentle, loving and caring in every way. Every member of the team allowed me to have a very positive and happy stay. My journey over the past six months with chemotherapy, MRIs etc. has often been interspersed with mini meltdowns, tears, anxieties, fears and nervousness. I was fully expecting my surgery days to include these emotions. However from arrival to departure I did not feel any of these - mainly due to the wonderful caring attitude of this BRILLIANT team. I felt totally relaxed and at ease, knowing that I was in capable hands at all times. All the staff had time for me, chatted to me - cared for me. I was the last to go down to theatre and two or three nurses kept coming and making sure I was OK. There were only three of us on the ward on Monday, and when I was on my own, nurses came and asked me if I was OK. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the SSSWard at Heatherwood for the love and care I experienced on Monday. My first stay in hospital is an experience I will remember with love. Thank you to you all and I wish you all the very best for the future. "
3081,i would recommend the ambulance service usually they are all brilliant. except for last night after a paramedic failed to book my 8 month old prem baby in after she had rolled off our bed and banged her head. we was left sat in the waiting area for hours and nobody even knew we was there because they didnt do the handover! when i confronted doctors at the hospital why i was still sat waiting after numerous children was in and out being seen my daughter had no obs done or any...thing the whole time we were there waiting because they were all completely unaware we was there and had to retake our details... not to mention the paramedic was falling asleep in the back of the ambulance on the way to the hospital.... all paramedics do an amazing job but last night couldve easily been avoided if anything wouldve happened to my daughter those paramedics wouldve been held responsible! See More ‚Äî at Good Hope Hospital A&e Department.
7013,I meant to have said 1 service very good
762,"On 28th December 2020 I arrived at wallingford maternity unit having been up all night with contractions, Midwife Emily met me there very shortly after. I had been suffering with high BP readings for the last few weeks of pregnancy but no signs of Pre-eclampsia detected in bloods or urine, and I was feeling really well - so rather frustrating as I was desperate to have my baby here. I'm sure it was the combination of the stress and worry of the current covid situation and ‚Äòwh...ite coat syndrome'. Unfortunately my BP had risen within an hour of me arriving. Emily discussed my situation with other midwives and they decided the baby needed continuous monitoring, which meant ambulance to the JR was needed. I was feeling so disappointed and scared (I've never been in an ambulance in my lifetime and I really wanted to avoid the JR in current circumstances!) but Emily was so calming and re-assuring, she'd be with me in the ambulance and there to support me the whole time. The ambulance arrived within minutes, but very thankfully and unexpectedly baby decided he'd make an appearance just as the paramedics arrived. Baby was absolutely fine and no JR needed, although if the situation was different (if I had ended up delivering in the ambulance or if my partner didn't get to the John Radcliffe on time) I would have never felt alone. The aftercare I received from Emily was amazing, she is a brilliant midwife and we will be forever grateful! We are so lucky to have Wallingford Maternity unit on our doorstep. Thank you! "
9764,"My sister has various mental health conditions and has been mentally very unwell for the past 8 months. She finally got sectioned last week and there was hope that she would be kept in hospital long enough to get her well again. A Dr at Green Park has today decided to discharge her and send her home to be seen by the home treatment team. She has a long history of not engaging with the community team and the home treatment team so she will now be basically back at square 1. I am completely shocked by the incompetence of these Dr's allowing a vulnerable person to just go home and get on with it. She has destroyed her flat and habitually floods her bathroom to the point where the elderly lady who lives underneath her, literally lives in fear. People wonder why mental health patients end up dead or end up hurting someone, well here's why. She should have and could have been sectioned for 28 days."
3479,I want to say a big thank you to nurse practitioner Sam Mason who looked after me in A&E on Friday evening. He was very kind to me. He dealt with my injuries expertly and gently. People like Sam give the NHS a good name.

I would like to say from the arrival of the paramedics to my being told I could go home, a period of about nine hours, my experience of the treatment I received was excellent.

8346,"Rude reception staff. I was here last week due to my daughter having an operation at the Children's hospital. Whilst she was having her operation the nurses suggested I went over to Costa coffee. So I got a coffee and something to eat and sat in the little waiting area by reception. There were no signs anywhere stating people couldn't sit here and there were staff sat in there eating lunch as well ad other people. Everyone was sat a good 2meters apart and were following the rules for all social distancing. Whilst sat here, I could hear the receptionist VERY loudly and aggressively to the security saying that people shouldn't be sat there eating their lunch, its for people who are waiting to be picked up by a taxi. She wouldn't have known the circumstances that people were sitting there and her actions made me feel very uncomfortable as well as others as many of us looked at each other, so much so that one lady went to ask if she was allowed to sit there whilst her husband was in clinic. The receptionist told her no she should sit on the ward. I appreciate with Covid things are very strange and people are trying to be careful. However as there were no signs and as staff were even sitting there how was anyone to know they couldn't sit there whilst waiting for their loved ones! ? I felt the way she handled this was awful! There was no need for her to shout it she could have quietly said something to security and then security handled it. Think the receptionist was very unprofessional and could do with some empathy training, especially as she is the first point of contact for many patients! "
9136,"We have just visited the children's unit for my toddler and the staff have been amazing, thank you so much much for the care you have provided us. Keep up the great work!!! "

2603,"A&E - excellent treatment and experience - I just wanted to feedback on my professional and excellent treatment received via A&E one morning at the beginning of May 2021 and subsequent care from the Trauma & Orthopaedic Department. I arrived in A&E at about 8.00 am having fallen and hurt my wrist, From check in, to triage, to radiology and nursing review the staff were professional and delightful. There was really good communication and pleasant communication - amazing in a Department which has been and continues to be under such incredible pressure. I think sometimes this delivery from the staff is taken for granted by patients and those in charge in hospitals - this should never be the case. The staff and what they do for all is invaluable and makes such a huge difference. Thank you so much to all there."

I was treated with care and respect what a fantastic team.
2964,I can understand the 2 hour wait. That just happens sometimes. And the doctors we saw were amazing. However (and we have friends who are dentists that are a absolutely shocked) I could not believe MaxFax wouldnt even come and look at my daughters teeth. One tooth needed moving back into position and MaxFax told the doctor to do it. He said that hed never done that before so there was no way he was going to touch it. Moving a tooth back into its correct position is time critical. Instead I had to ring around lots of dentists this morning and pay for her to get the treatment MaxFax could have given her last

Calling about her Condition in the evening the nurse realised that the wards cordless phone didn't reach so encouraged us to phone her mobile phone number and he handed her phone to my mother. This is exceptional service and very kind. Far far beyond that which could be expected. My thanks go out to her.

2751,"Entrance to hospital - Patients queued at the entrance to the hospital as requested. The 2 Healthcare workers, as on my previous visits to the hospital, were seated at their workstation beyond the second double doors waiting to check paperwork and advise patients to use hand sanitizer prior to proceeding to their allocated clinic. On my visit, the very obvious change to this procedure was a support worker greeting patients as they entered 1st double doors, their paperwork was taken off each one, checked, handed back and they were invited to proceed; I noted the vast majority proceeded, neglected to use provided hand sanitizer and the next patient was invited in by the support worker. At no time did the worker sanitize their hands in-between patients. The patients then handed their letter to the administration member at the reception desk of their designated clinic. The virus was potentially now being spread at an alarming rate. The admin staff were also dealing with clinical staff at their workstation or in their office. I have nothing but admiration and praise for the care your staff provide and I do not feel that there is anything more they could do to improve their patient care. I sincerely felt as a recently retired RGN this practice at the hospital entrance should be brought to your attention, not as a complaint, merely as a tool to improve practice. Thank you"
4758,"Cataract Surgery - Great Team - My second cataract op yesterday was so good. From the welcome in reception and the ward to the gentle walk back to the door at the end, the treatment was fantastic. Everyone in the team was professional and caring, the atmosphere friendly and positive, and the outcomes great. Thankyou everybody."
8293,"Walk in vaccination today - My second vaccination is in the diary for 24th July, but driving past the Leisure Centre in Barnstaple just now I thought I would enquire if there was space for a walk-in vaccination today - and there was! 10 minutes from parking up, I am now sitting in the waiting bay drinking my complimentary water having had my vaccination. It couldn't have been easier. Feel delighted. üòÄ"
9359,Cardiology - NHS heros - Thank you to all the staff at RUH Bath from A&E to cardiology for helping to save my dad's life. The staff communicated with us and supported us as a family as well as my dad through an extremely stressful time for us all. Without them and the decisions they made my dad wouldn't be with us today. I will be forever thankful!

5086,"Very quick and organised, friendly."
1650,Orthopaedics - Excellent service - My stay on ward 15 at Burnley was excellent. Everyone was very kind and my hip replacement was a success. All the staff are dedicated and nothing was too much trouble. 
747,"Exceptional. My dad was admitted with severe breathing difficulties. He was initially assessed in the Resuscitation Room where the staff were so calm, efficient and kind. This was a very frightening time for us that was made that little bit easier because of their care. I wish I could remember that names of the individuals who looked after Dad to mention you all. Dad was transferred to Duppas 1 Ward where he remained for almost two weeks over the recent Christmas period. In that time he was cared for by a truly wonderful team of people and it was heartening to see the same faces appearing each morning and evening to look after the patients on the ward. From the doctors, nurses and HCAs looking after his medical needs to the lovely staff who brought him his meals and cups of tea, all were cheerful, attentive and kind. I'd like to say a special thank you to Maddie, Katie, Anna, Angelo, Sharan and Sharma. Your care and compassion - and the laughter Sharan! - made Dad's time with you a truly positive experience despite the seriousness of his illness."

I have anxiety & was extremely nervous for my procedure. At all levels from the Consultant, doctors & the nurses it was fantastic & everything was explained simply. The nurses in particular were wonderful. "
9030,Neurology - Poor care - Hospital cancelled all appointments but did not let any of the patients know. The website is not up to date and does not give accurate information to patients. There is no understanding that patients without coronavirus may also need treatment. It is a bad time for anyone to fall ill.

7117,"Haematology - Miscommunication - I am currently receiving treatment at PAH for a DVT in my right leg, and recently started taking oral Warfarin. I received a telephone call yesterday from the Warfarin clinic advising my latest blood test result and dosage for the day, and had a blood test arranged for today. I subsequently received an email confirming the blood test appointment for tomorrow. I contacted the PALS team by email, and, within 5 minutes received a telephone call from Haematology which resolved the query. Thank you PALS and Haematology for dealing with this so promptly."

2956,Dentistry and Orthodontics - Raedwald Day Surgery - I have just been to the Raedwald Day Surgery Unit as I was having oral surgery. All the staff were fantastic from start to finish making my short stay as comfortable as possible. I can't praise them all highly enough.
5186,"Their service is horrendous. Receptionist mislead me, then closed the phone very rude and ruined the chance to get the medication for my son . To talk with the doctor needs to wait for days. Very disappointed and disgusted! "

8236,My daughter had a bead stuck in her ear. We went to Hastings A&E but the person handling it pushed it in as far as it went. We've been told to contact Eastbourne ENT team and 2 weeks later a lovely Nurse Christoper took it out. I am forever grateful! ‚ù§Ô∏è
8209,I attended the Mobile Breast Screening Unit which is situated in the carpark. The service users were asked to just arrive at their appointment time (not early) and to wear face coverings at all times. There was a one-way system in operation so service users never came into contact with each other. The procedure was efficient (as usual).
3523,"Don't know - Emergency Department that doesn't seem to care - Having consulted 111 I was advised to head to A&E for a notional 12 noon arrival time. I understood this was not an appointment time, but was still surprised to be in the waiting room for the best part of 5 hours after that just to have a few blood tests run and be sent home again. What worried me more was the way that the A&E unit seemed so uninterested in the wellbeing of its patients - patients who are inevitably super-anxious or in pain when they arrive. We were made to queue outside in the rain for half an hour before we reached the check in table indoors. One young man who had had a severe blow the the head, been up all night in another A&E unit in Frimley and was standing in the queue just ahead of us simply keeled over and fainted, hitting his head on the stone wall. Another mum with a restless toddler had to yell for help from other patients as her toddler got its fingers wedged under the electric doors that kept flapping open when people in the queue outside moved - and all her rescuers set the door flapping even more. The toddler had drunk something potentially dangerous that morning already: I can't imagine how much extra stress the door situation added to their morning, quite unnecessarily. Once inside, there was no explanation of a system. I can't be alone in not knowing what a 'streaming nurse' is. Moreover, she was sat behind a screen so no one could see who was calling their name out. I went to the wrong window, only to be patronised by another member of staff who clearly just thought I was being stupid and rather rudely pointed me back towards the obscured counter where I should have been. The same streaming nurse got quite annoyed when one lady in the waiting room didn't respond. It turned out the lady was deaf. She couldn't hear the shouting, never mind see the nurse behind her solid screen. She could only lip read. When asked what the likely wait length might be after I'd been there for 4 hours, one of the desk staff said she would enquire and get back to me. She never did. I have a family at home, and needed to make provision for them. The wait times on the notice by the entrance to the check in desk were far off the mark, in actual fact, but no one once updated the people in the waiting room. I know that A&E is a busy place and the priority is on saving lives etc. But it feels as if the system is more important than the patients, and that Covid measures - now being rethought and reduced in other sensitive locations - have become so entrenched that the main aim is to keep patients out. It was a disappointing experience of the Emergency Department, after very favourable introductions to other areas of the hospital since our move here. The fact that I was sent a text message asking for feedback, and then going to be CHARGED for the privilege of sending it to you was what finally got me to log on and write this review. Please put the caring dimension back into A&E. It's surely better for recovery...? "
4698,"I have experienced excellence all the way through my treatment from all the staff in Gynaecology who I thank so very much Mr Vindla, Mr Dudill, Alison and all the amazing people in front and behind the scenes. Also all the wonderful staff on ward 14 who go above and beyond everyday. I have met such lovely people of whom all do a brilliant job.

3638,"I've had many bad experiences with the A&E service here, but I feel the nurses that cared for me during my most recent stay need acknowledgement! I'm having chemotherapy so being in hospital around sick people during covid makes me so anxious, however there was a nurse working the night shift cant remember her name we joked about having small women syndrome. she had auburn hair an a Welsh accent. she made me feel so at ease from the second I walked in, and the nurse that took... over from her in the morning was called Emily. she went above an beyond to make me comfortable and I can't thank her enough. whilst there I heard Emily being sworn at by a patient, physically assaulted by a patient and it made my blood boil. these nurses are there to help you, nobody likes being in hospital bur trust me when I tell you she is one of the good ones and she / nobody deserves to be treated like that when they are trying to help, if you can't respect someone with a genuine passion for helping people then stay home and suffer! I've came across some rude medical staff in my time. but there are good ones to!!!! See More"
8213,"poor maternity care - hi to whoever reads this, i was admitted for an induced birth at this trust. had an allergic reaction to PROPESS. which was left in place for hours. I was in severe pain gripping a sink with just codeine and paracetamol for 3 hours. I was having constant contractions no break. i requested gas and air was told it would have to be prescribed which is lie. very concerning as my husband and mother where asking for pain relief for me (am aware people are not allowed a birthing partner at the moment until confirmed in labour). I was left waiting to go the labour suite for an hour still with no gas and air. after an hour of being on labour suite i was confirmed to be 10cm. maneuvers where done not explained to me afterwards. i found out by googling that my son was dystocia . this traumatic experience left me with PTSD i was only offered a debrief once at the time it was few days after having the baby I was in shock. I put x3 complaints in about the poor care that I received the responses where written really badly saying things like i wasn't able to have anything else at that point and they do not have gas and air on the maternity ward. I wasn't happy with this so i wrote to local MP then I was offered another debrief that I attended was told that their is a culture on the maternity ward not to give gas and air and the midwife could of gone to get some from another ward they said I should of had gas and air but did not seem keen on addressing this culture on the maternity ward. I had sent to the trust a page of the NICE guidlines for induction from 2007 the response in the debrief was they are only guidlines and as a trust they do not have to follow them - I believe women deserve better care than this also It was addressed in the meeting future births for me they said i was asking too much as in gas and air without assessment I have since spoke to a nurse consultant at another trust and she said i was being reasonable and it was no problem "

77,"Accident and emergency services - Disgusting - The nurses just sit around and do nothing and don't have a clue what they are doing, they are rude and look down on you when you ask for information and they discharge people after 7 as they discharged and transferred to another hospital 3 elderly ladies this evening at 10pm. They don't even make the beds and made my nan make her own bed at 2am and threw her coat on her. Was trying to ask a woman about information and she started walking off and was very unpolite and rude. They were not checking on the patients and left observations later than 4 hours then an ambulance man came in and had a go at at nurse as this elderly woman didn't have a check up for over 4 hours. My nan was meant to have an x-ray all day but they finally did it at 9pm at night. Didn't give my nan her medication also. The hospital is tiny and the nurses sat on there phones all the time. I am very disappointed in this hospital and will definitely never come back for sure. "

9439,Too much noise on the ward again. Some of it is staff shouting loudly at one another. One of the worst is the HCA who bellowed at me the other day. Her communication style needs some work. They shouldn't be arguing about office politics near pts anyway. @ChelwestFT
1958,The same old at this hospital more staff than patients yet you still wait & wait hours to have your obs done. They love the 4 hour rule they use it to their advantage. So be prepared to wait 4 hours at least. The reception staff are rude and think they have some entitlement. It's like a production line at amazon only amazon treat their boxes with more care.

7478,"Ophthalmology - So disappointed - After several visits / tests undertaken in eye casualty, I was admitted to Ward 20 with a serious infection. Having never ever been in hospital before I was understandably frightened but I was assured i would be looked after. I spent 5 days in hospital in total and I'm sorry to say it wasn't pleasant. Given the current circumstances going on in the world the ward had minimal patients (emergencies only) but still a lot of staff, so I expected the care level to be even higher. I had to have intensive treatment of eye drops every 30 mins (all through the night) this was my only treatment and yet the nurses (on the week days) had to reminded every hour to give me my treatment, which in the middle of the night became very tedious! I sat for nearly 3 hours at one point waiting for drops. Given the current pandemic everyone is praising the NHS and I have to say the doctors that dealt with me (and 2 of the nurses) were truly amazing but the rest of the nursing staff were beyond a joke and did not make patients feel at ease at all; they were lazy, uninterested, focussed more on gossiping about the current covid situation, what pictures they could put on social media to get praise for their work and more interested in getting their free food. On my last day a trainee nurse was in charge of giving me my treatment, he was completely incompetent - he was unaware of which drops I needed and when and had to be reminded constantly. He even forgot to collect my prescriptions and therefore it took 5 hours longer to be discharged! I was told I had to be in hospital for the best treatment but frankly I could have done better in the comfort and safety of my own home. I understand times are difficult but patients deserve the best possible care when having to stay in hospital."

5062,"False promises from William Harvey Hospital - Was told by an A&E doctor at William Harvey in Ashford that in a few days I'll get a call from them with an URGENT appointment for an endoscopy. Heard nothing. My GP didn't have a clue what I was on about so I'm guessing the doctor didn't tell them. Managed to get through to main reception where a poor receptionist on her own was fielding calls to departments who don't answer the phone. Endoscopy and A&E in my experience. No call queuing system so after a while waiting the phone hangs up and your forced to try calling again. NHS = No Help Sorry. What will end up happening, is I'll be back in A&E taking valuable bed space. To avoid that, they just need to get organised.

4792,Cardiology - cardiac emergeny care - just wow at the level of care i received during a recent admission during heart attack - surgery carried out almost as soon as i was taken to theatre and despite the emergency - the staff kept me calm during the entire process. There was even some banter and good humour - like when i had to stop asking questions at a very critical part of the task or when i had to please straighten my arm as they needed me to do this so they could get the stent up the artery. Although this is a life or death experience i felt totally safe in their hands. The after care was totally wonderful and nothing was too much trouble for all of the staff. Was all done with kindness and a smile. Its my first time in that hospital other than for dental treatment years ago - i was taken there for urgent care not available at my own local large hospital. They were so incredibly busy like non stop the whole time i was in there - so many patients suffering from heart conditions day and night. Faultless flawless service and as good as if i paid for personal care from my own pocket. We are so lucky to have an amazing NHS service. I will be writing to thank the staff personally but just wanted to do a public review as reassurance to anyone worried about the type of care they might get - particularly in the cardiology department.

1772,"So, I'm finally home. Not very happy though. I was just dumped into a @NewcastleHosps hospital car with my medication. Not told of any medication changes of which there are several. Some of them major changes. 1/3"
7279,"PEOPLE PLEASE BEWARE Let this be a warning to anyone undergoing treatment Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust ‚Äì DO NOT DARE TO CRITICISE OR COMPLAIN. We got this message loud and clear. They will make your life a living hell! And your life is literally in their hands. They are like pigeons pecking an injured bird to death or bullies ganging up on the weak child in the playground, who should have known not to tell the teacher. You wouldn't believe how evil these so-called health professionals can be so please take care."
6071,I found the nursing staff on the ward to be excellent and very hard working and dedicated to making my time on the ward easier. I particularly commend a staff nurse called Wassim and a HCA called Jackie.
2304,All staff were caring and compassionate. We were given a lot of support and love during our stay making the birth of our daughter very special. We cannot thank you all enough for the best day of our lives. We are completely in love.
550,staff very friendly and informative they make you feel relaxed and understand your issues
6184,"1/2 So, flu has arrived. Not for me - Mum & Dad. Despite both having long term conditions they decided not have their jab & are seriously regretting it! With Xmas around the corner, it's looking like a day in bed, not with their grandchildren celebrating! @HPFT_NHS"
3966,Not over the top good but I was just satisfied with my experience primarily because I was informed that I dont have any everlasting injury
3404,#Ambulance the most powerful frames from this programme are the names and photos of those 2 @NWAmbulance paramedics who sadly passed away during #covid19 #thankyouforyourservice
7532,The worst staff and pathetic acknowledgement of emergency patients. Better remove it as emergency and name it a pathetic waiting area to sit and die with pain.
7677,Leigh from physio was excellent Informative supporting and empathetic Excellent appointment
9433,"Its cool how in @ChtownPE you can go out to parks and interact with people again, but when my mother in law is rushed in for a major surgery, @QEHFoundation refuses to let my father in law stay in the hospital with her and nurses make him leave the hospital and tell him"

7568,Please the nurse look my dad
3996,"General Surgery - Exceptional care - Honestly the conduct of all the teams that helped me with eye surgery, and my huge anxiety. They was all so caring, calming and did there job amazing. I wasnt under pilgrim originally, they accepted me as an emergency where no other would. I was ready to run out the door with my surgical pants on lol. From day care staff, porters, anethitatist and helpers, surgeon. Was all amazing, highly professional and catered for my whooping anxiety. Thankyou all that was involved. "
8908,Great setup for covid
8095,"Children's & Adolescent Services - Excellent care - My 2 year old was brought in by ambulance, with a bad case of croup. It was a scary time for us both, but every single member of staff we met was superb. The care could not have been better and we were both very well looked after and put at ease. We've recently moved to the area and are so pleased that this is our local hospital."
2249,"Thank you @WhippsCrossHosp- I finally had MRI scan on my shoulder after waiting nearly 14 weeks! However I did not consent to contrast much to the dismay of the radiologist-the time spent explaining why I refused, could have been avoided, if I was asked when the app was made x"
6898,"Accident and emergency services - Amazing doctors and nurses at A&E Majors - I would like to thank the doctors and the lovely nurses at A&E Majors, which I attended on 8th of November. Their professional, caring and reassuring manner have helped me so much while I was having a difficult time."
1767,Huge thanks to @AlderHey and Mr Bruce for looking after my 16 year old son George this am. Such a slick organisation from start to finish.
9483,excellent department every one is friendly and caring i could not have been treated better everything was well explained and i was at ease
9685,Big flare up in my thoracic Endo on Thursday so landed myself in A&E again @uclh with breathing trouble and coughing up blood. Thankfully calming a bit now. #endometriosis #endowarrior #endosister #chronicillness Thanks to @NHSuk
2825,Helpful advice but difficult to get full benefit without physical consultation.
5370,Paulton hospital shut apparently due to lady with suspected corona virus .
8352,"Geriatric Medicine - Amazing staff, but the same two problems - An elderly relative went into A & E on a Thursday. She then went into A.A.U. I'm not sure how long she was there as, despite numerous phone calls, I never got to talk to anyone who knew anything at all. A doctor got in touch with me on the Saturday (ward 43 by now) to ask me to go in to try and talk the elderly lady into allowing them to take blood and have scans / X-rays. Many hours later the mission was accomplished but I actually think this was thanks far more to the staff than myself. I cannot believe how kind, compassionate, patient and caring the staff are even when faced with some very obstinate, irrational and awkward patients. All the staff on the ward were amazing and helpful and tried their absolute best. The only two problems were the same ones that have plagued Pinderfields constantly for years. One being trying to get through to a ward on the phone. It can quite literally take hours which can be very stressful when you desperately want information about someone you love. The other is that when a patient is being discharged there is always a wait of several hours because tablets are never delivered from the pharmacy expediently. This time we ended up bypassing the pharmacy as I knew the patient had enough at home. On another occasion a ward let the patient go home as he was very insistent and I went back the following morning for the medication. This is always a bottleneck in the system that cannot help to free up beds."
7644,Waste of space
9063,"Excellent care from theatre to nurses to food i felt safe and had the utmost healthcare, huge thank you"
4053,All my needs were met very happy | Needs a button upon leaving the ward as can't always see anyone wanting to leave and nurses station is at the top of the ward
5017,"Appointments office. Attitude dismal. Female senior admin officer, just kept talking, was not giving me a chance to answer the questions she was asking. Appeared to be full of her own self importance. Had a bullying attitude. When I asked her to stop & allow me to speak, she stopped for a short while, then continued where she left off. When I tried to speak again, she hung up the phone. This is not what you would expect from a Hospital."
9314,"Geriatric Medicine - Poor hospital - The nursing was poor and my father was taken off all his pain meds during his stay there thus hampering his rehabilitation programme completely. The nurses and a Doctor then failed to pick up Sepsis in my father. If nothing else, the staff in charge need to be aware of the signs of Sepsis, a deadly disease, requiring urgent treatment. "
2147,Every service i have used there has been run efficiently and by friendly and caring staff
9890,Ophthalmology - Feed back - I two had an appointment at clinic 3 and was horrify by the disregard for patient confidentially when checking in and I see the other feedback about this hasn't been answered by the pals team but if you had good thing's to say about Addenbrookes it get a reply same day?? that why I'm leaving feedback so they can maybe try and sort this out. 
7143,"The appointments line staff are very friendly and helpful. They explained my referral status in great detail and gave me good advice. There can be a long wait time, but that is probably due to people calling for no reason and wasting NHS staffs time."
9334,Feedback 1 Very good (sent with Gentle Effect)
3073,Staff are lovely and helpful. Really friendly and approachable
5602,"Well I do NOT like being on this side of the hospital but my goodness @AiredaleNHSFT is fantastic! Everyone I've come across has been amazing! Despite the ankle I feel so lucky From the paramedics, mountain rescue, ED staff right through to theatre staff and the ward staff... https://t.co/wUKWq1tGPi"

5827,My good deed of the day done. Got up early to take a lovely elderly lady to her hospital appointment this morningüòä
9415,They were responsive and considerate to my needs and queries.
1285,"Gynaecology - Lack of communication - I had excellent service diagnosing an ovarian cyst at Redditch and then Worcester emergency departments last weekend, 12-14th November. I was told that my scans would be reviewed in the MDT meeting on Thursday this week, 19th Novemeber with the mention of oncology. I would then get a phone call to explain what they thought and what they were going to do on Thursday or Friday. I chased it up on Friday afternoon, as I had not been called. I am still none the wiser. I have been left in pain for 10 days not being able to go to work and have had no communication when they clearly stated, more than once, that I would be called after the meeting. After what was an excellent inital service I have been left in pain and worried. I do not think it is acceptable to be told what would happen and then not to hear. There has obviously been a breakdown in communication between departments. The emergency gynacology department promising one thing but then this not being followed through by the relevant department. "
1395,"Ophthalmology - Fantastic, professional service - Had minor surgery to remove cyst from eyelid. From the first, initial appointment to the second one to remove the cyst, the staff and nurses were friendly, courteous and highly professional. The operation was quick, pain free and successful. Everyone should be proud of their outstanding contribution to the wonderful NHS."
123,"People were lovely, ran smoothly and felt safe. Excellent service.Parking as ever is challenging"
4136,Have been well looked after with 3 ops and a broken wrist over the last 2 years
713,I was sent by my GP to ambulatory care at NSECH on 19/08/21 for surgical assessment. The care I received myself and witnessed others receiving was excellent. Well done and a massive thank you to all those who looked after me.
6806,42 years ago today I started as a student orthopaedic nurse at the age of 16 in the RNOH Stanmore - such a wonderful time with my NHS family - wouldn't have changed any of it -and very pleased to be back in London again @GSTTnhs
2452,General Surgery - Fantastic people and atmosphere - I had an injection for pain management which some people find traumatic the doctor who did it and all of his team are amazing and make you feel at ease. Everyone I dealt with could not do enough people are eager to complain but not praise. Yhank god for our national health Mrs Greta Skelton
9167,
2991,"Quiet, few people around and only a little waiting time. Met with hand sanitiser too. Only thing that would be better is to take temperatures of everyone on arrival. Brilliant service overall."
8191,Phoned and spoke to 111. Offered me 1:30 appointment. When at reception for clinic 1 the Bangladeshi young arrogant man refused to check or acknowledge that I came in as an appointment. After reluctantly checking he found me on the system and says take a seat! Argues and says it's not a appointment but an estimated arrival time! Rude arrogant and pathetic. Can't believe he got a job as a receptionist! 
944,Worst hostpital not helping other people That need help
7727,Shout out to @BucksHealthcare Stoke Mandeville Hospital for looking after me the past few days! #NHS
1064,Vascular surgery - A superb and professional experience - I would like to thank the hospital for the treatment I received and the care on Mersea ward post op. Please convey my thanks to the vascular surgeons and nurses on Mersa ward. I do have a criticism though. This concerns food. I was offered a cheese salad. The tomatoes were as hard as a bullet as was the cucumber. Completely inedible. Such a waste of precious money. Surely the buyers or suppliers must be in control of the food supplied. It's not rocket science. 
9930,#vaccine done! Thank you @NewcastleHosps @NHSEngland Relief is huge knowing my protection against #COVID19 starts today üëèüèªüíôüåàüôè
3194,The treatment was done thoroughly and professionally. Nothing the staff could have done better as far as Im concerned. I was in and out quicker than I expected and the results were clearly explained to me. Ive had a little pain/discomfort since but was given helpful information leaflets which are helpful in that regard. Overall very satisfied.
2712,"Accident and emergency services - Thank you! - I cannot thank the staff enough they were FANTASTIC! A+E was EXTREMELY busy all the staff were working their socks off. All the nurse and the doctors were so caring, compassionate and very through in every aspect of my treatment. I had a neck brace on, my head was in blocks and I was laid flat. This meant I was staring at the ceiling for hours. But everyone came to my eye level to speak to me and treat me which made such a difference. I was in a lot of pain and the nurses and doctors made sure I was kept as pain free as possible throughout. I can't remember the names of the staff that treated me. But thank you, you made such a difference to an absolutely awful day. Thank you again. "
8996,everyone explained carefully and when the procedure stared they were careful and kind
3725,Most the staff where really nice. There where a few that just didnt seem to know what was going on. There is a serious lack of communication in the hospital. Never more so when it comes to discharge! The food was diabolical I was unable to eat almost anything on my 7 day stay.
6859,"Helpful, kind, understanding, listened, gave clear advice and instructions, empathetic and encouraging. Could not be bettered."
2599,"At Derriford Hospital in #plymouth for Covid vaccine. Everyone is so polite, professional and kind as always. @UHP_NHS @AnnJamesNHS #covid"
2367,"Great practice - Supportive staff with professional approaches, always ready to help a person in need. The wards appeared to have quality equipment, very clean and tidy areas! All staff provided with appropriate PPE."
6921,"Awful experience - There is a distinct lack of care from the so called professionals within this organisation - I got the distinct impression that they were 'just going through the motions' and 'ticking boxes'. I needed help and it just wasn't offered sadly... the therapists didn't even ask what my problem was, let alone attempt to find a resolution. I wish I'd never been referred to these people."
5894,"All staff were utterly amazing. So friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and reassuring."
6741,Communication
1274,Covid vaccinations - We were telephoned by our surgery about 9. 45 this morning and asked if both my husband and I wanted to have our Covid vaccinations today. We jumped at the chance and had an appointment booked for 12. 10. We attended a surgery in our locality. It was extremely well organised and efficient. The staff were all welcoming and reassuring. I know there is still a long way to go but it has made me feel a bit more confident that this virus could be tamed. We are both hugely relieved that our surgery has done us proud by being proactive and organised. Thankyou so much. 
118,"Not free, could get really expensive. Just park up the road from Nisa. (Stanton Road). It's free there"
6811,Had tests done after waiting 2 hours. Not a problem. Then had to wait another 10 hours to see a doctor. Doctor was good but there was a lack of staff across the board.
138,"Very very bad experience. I waited more than 3 months to see a Rheumatologist in this Hospital. When I went there, beside the fact that I had to wait more than 45 minutes than my appointment was scheduled I met a doctor who had no knowledge about my condition, even though I went with the test results from my country which proves I have a rheumatology problem. She consulted me and after so many questions with positive answers doctor concluded that nothing is wrong with me. I think the doctors here in UK are not trained enough and it is a waste of time to wait so long for 'specialist appointments'."

8784,"The staff at Grimsby need to give themselves a dam good pat on the back and the managers should seriously praise their nurses!

5456,"Accident and emergency services - 7 hour wait - I arrived at approximately 01:30am and waited a couple of hours to see nurse, who was very nice and professional. I went through my issues ie badly infected eye and that I have had a very bad throat, chesty cough and that I also have been treated for prostate cancer, plus I have had my lleft kidney removed because of cancer, I also mentioned I have recently been to my doctor for headaches and that I have PBC of the liver.. Its now 09:00 and I am just been seen"
6060,"This is an efficiently run operation based in a set of buildings that are showing their age. The people are very friendly and helpful and doctors authoritative. However, I did have two test samples being lost in their system which could have had grave consequences. I'm surprised by this lack of systematic correctness."
7881,"#SIREN clinics are continuing every day, with over 100 members of @DCHFT staff seen every 2 weeks.

9719,"Maternity services - not great communication - it would be very helpful if the hospital can tell patients or communicate via appointment letters that they are not allowed to bring young children to maternity appointments. I understand its because of the covid 19 situation but if your a single parent with no one else in your household being able to look after the child, where does the child go when you need to attend appointments. It was very annoying and caused me great inconvenience to only be told this when I attended the appointment with my young child. I was turned away and asked tk rebook. Please can the administration staff be more communicating in letters or on the phone in the future so other mothers don't have to go through the same embarrassment."
6634,ATN Cars provide private transportation to this outpatient assessment centre. It is easy to pickup / drop off passengers right outside the centre. On road paid parking is available.
2639,"Diagnostic Imaging - Super fast! Very professional - Had a CT scan today in the mobile unit at 7:25pm, I was in and out with in 10 minutes, receptionist in X-rayB was lovely, very polite and friendly. The guys in the mobile scanner made me feel at ease, professional and even a little giggle. I was terrified (very claustrophobic) but they put that at ease without me even mentioning it! Could not praise them enough today! Every single member of staff was so pleasant. What an amazing little team and so positive considering the circumstances. I had to leave a positive review! I came away from the hospital smiling with not a single grumble üòÅüòÅ"
6908,"I was thrilled and surprised to see the medical professional featured at 3.32 minutes in the Queen's Speech today (shaking her hand at Papworth Hospital.). His name is Ged and he is an amazing wonderful guy. He helped me through my MRI procedure a few weeks ago at Papworth hospital. He was patient and kind and he really helped this very nervous, anxious and scared lady get through the entire process. He explained everything to me ... the machine itself, the process, what I w...as required to do etc.... totally putting me at ease. He didn't even call for a porter afterwards. He took me back to the ward himself so he could chat and interact with me a bit longer knowing how bewildered I was. Lovely, lovely man. I'm so grateful to all the amazing medical staff who have helped me pull through that difficult time. Merry Christmas to all my family and friends but especially to all the hard working & dedicated medical people who are working today and caring for those who need it in hospitals such as Papworth. Sincere thanks and gratitude to you all."
5577,Maternity services - Disappointing Start - Told I would be called back by a Dr the same day - last Tuesday. Still waiting... This was my first contact with the hospital for antenatal care for my first child. Disappointing start. 
686,Healthcare in the UK is a joke compared to US healthcare. The experience is like being in the DMV but worse. 6 hours in the ER. 4 hours follow up visit the next morning because there is no ultrasound overnight. 5 stars for the great people. 0 stars for public healthcare scheme.
9625,"Review based on waiting time, not service. I was a walk-in patient, after brief chat with nurse was advised to get back in 2 hours for the appointment with doctor. Up to the time of appointment was in the emergency waiting room, but had to wait 2 more hours and reception kept telling me that due to overload I have to wait a bit more. So after 2 hours of waiting of ARRANGED APPOINTMENT I had to leave as I could not wait anymore due to my health condition. I do appreciate this is an emergency service, why than promise any kind of appointment and waste 4 h of my time? "

9361,I had a very good experience
7649,Mental Health - Adults of all ages - Not fit for purpose - I was referred to the LMHT after deterioration in mental health. After waiting 6 months for appointments was granted no more than 20 minutes consultation with a psychiatrist who just gave me a basic peep talk. I had to insist on medication review as he was happy to fobbed me off with nothing. Crisis team has never been in touch with me. Totally disgrace! 
3336,Dr Gail Anne Haley
1784,"I speak to my elderly mom every day on the phone. Yesterday, I saw her for the first time in weeks, for about 30 seconds, as they transferred her from hospital to physical rehab. She says that brief contact cheered her up immensely. I could see the color come back into her face."
6905,"Dementia Services - Appaling service 1 hour hanging on phone to get reply - Not sure if this is really dementia services complaint, but the list of options for reviews does not include communication or wards, and this was an incident relating to my demented mother. Tried for 15 minutes to get a line in to the hospoital using the direct number I had been given: permanently engaged. I therefore tried switchboard who told me that there was only 1 line in to the ward. As I am a hospital coI nwas then given 2 more numbers to try.nsultant, I knew that was a lie and told the switchboard operator so. I was then given 2 more numbers to try. I used 3 phones and dialed all 3 numbers until I had all phones ringing nout. It took 40 minutes for one of the lines to be answered! That is completely unacceptable and would certainly not be tolerated on any of the wards I work on. "

Very efficiently dealt with from the telephone call from a nurse the day before to go through all the paperwork involved and what to expect. Seen on the day promptly by my nurse to do the preliminaries like blood pressure, cannula etc. Procedure carried out and outcome was good.

7758,Since the hospital has been updated it is much better! They are a very efficient hospital and although very much understaffed still do their utmost best to help and care for all.
8226,"Accident and emergency services - Treatment without judgment - Yesterday paramedics and A&E staff helped me through a traumatic experience, which ultimately was self inflicted. They didn't judge me, if anything they treated me as a friend. How they can do that under such pressure is beyond me, especially as I was using resources which are stretched so thin now. I don't know who the paramedics were specifically, but I'd like them to know that they really helped me and I'm grateful for that. We should all try to remember that what we are now asking of the NHS is monumental, mistakes are bound to be made, but we are extremely lucky to have them. "

All my appointments at RPH and Chorley were on time and everyone I came in contact with be it Consultant, Registrar, Nurse and support staff were terrific. Everyone took time to explain things in a simple and respectful way even though the staff are under pressure due to Covid-19. I can't get over how efficient the NHS really is with joined up approach. Thank you for great care and treatment."
2889,"Gynaecology - Compassionate care is a healer - thank you - I wanted to extend my sincere thanks to the two nurses and gynaecologist who saw me after 4 hours in A&E, following a miscarriage. At a time when I was in shock, very emotional, in pain and exhausted, I was treated with so much compassion, empathy and care. I believe that the level of care I received has already contributed not only to my physical recovery, but (possibly more importantly) to my ability to heal emotionally, and I am so grateful for that. Very lucky to have this facility and such excellent staff in Bristol. Thank you. "
4158,so I am a person who use cash and like to have some change with me and sometimes I can forget my card and not be aware that public places operate now cashless hm public places should inform by letter everyone in town that if person would like to park by hospital should have only - only card and can't pay with cash!!!! fortunately 5 years I had no reason to go to hospital so I didn't know that hospital is cashless now - in my opinion cash option should be still available!!!! for people who one day will forget their wallet with bank cards when they rush to go to hospital and got only F& percenting cash with them!!! 
5701,"Children's & Adolescent Services - Fantastic - All I can say is over the past year myself, my husband and my daughter have all needed the hospital. I had my daughter there in June 2020 and my birth was going wrong but the doctors / nurses and midwives were outstanding and saved mine and my babys life! My husband then got diagnosed with cancer and they didn't waste no time and once again the team who cared for him were exceptional! I then needed my gallbladder removing and had a great experience with the team who cared for me and lastly my daughter had to stay in for 2 nights and all I can say is the service and care we have all received from the people who clean the hospital to the top consultants they are all a credit to the NHS and I cannot thank them enough for all the help and care they have given us! Thank you so much! "

680,"I had a labour here in May 2020. Very mixed impressions... In the one hand, the night nurse was horrible, slow (too slow), instead of help she did what she thought was right, instead of doing what the pregnant women asked her to do. A strange doctor who made a fast scan (3 or 5 minutes!!) prior to stimulation of the labour, and said that the baby's position is ok for normal labour...That finally finished with the emergency Caesarian section after 15 hours of unsuccessful contractions with the stimulation (half of it with not working epidural anaesthesia!, blood pressure up to 200 and temperature about 39, 4 before the operation)... In the other hand, a great morning team of surgeon and nurses who made a CSection very fast and professional and I'm very thankful to them, that I finally saw my daughter! This team said that the baby's position wasn't ok for a normal labour, and I found it out only after the Csection... Also I'd like to thanks to all the 8 ward (postnatal) team, who helped me and my daughter struggle with the infection after labour during the long week. They provided very good care. I'm not sure I'd like to come back here again if I have one more baby. However, not sure as well in other London's hospital, where are a lot of similar situations happens..."

My dad would've been in a wheelchair if our family didn't get involved and do a complain and went to an private chiropractor..

I called in January as our appointment with consultant was cancelled due to Covid restrictions. We were anxious about knowing results of tests but the next available appointment would have been in April. The lady promptly suggested that she could email the consultant to send a letter with results which was already a great solution and relief for us. After a couple of hours she rang me and she was able to reassure us that the consultant had emailed her back with no abnormal result. I can't remember the name of this lady but I would love if anybody could refer to her how great was her help. People like her really make the difference in people's lives. Thank you ever so much to the lady of gastro department i had the provilege to talk with in January this year.Please contact me if you need more details. Elena Lombardi"

Regretfully, because of my nervousness, I was unable to register all the names of the staff who were so good to me that day. However, I must register my satisfaction at their dedication towards me. Starting with the Consultant who was going to perform the procedure. He was friendly, professional and reassuring. Followed by the anaesthetist who was just as friendly and efficient and even put on my tight socks for me. Throughout my wait several members of staff performed their duties with professionalism and care. At Theatre No. 4, I was met by, again friendly and professional nurses, who put me at ease by talking to me in Portuguese and cracking jokes amongst themselves. I was feeling very vulnerable and apprehensive, but their attitude helped me immensely. Please let them know how fantastic they are! To be honest the whole team are worth the highest of praise. From the nurses who attended to me at Recovery and their smiles, the catering lady who brought me tea and an excellent chicken and leak pie! And finally, the porter who wheeled to the Exit because I was still a bit unsteady and worried about getting lost in the labyrinthine corridors. In these though times because of the pandemic they are all courageous people who are a credit to our NHS. Today the 15th November I am recovering fine with no infections and the pains have abated somewhat."

I am now on a cardiac rehabilitation programme. During the whole process, from my talk with my GP (Highfield Surgery, Hazlemere) the arrival of paramedics within 5 mins, my care at Wycombe Hospital, I was treated with the utmost care.

4588,Unhappy - I am not happy because I have had a bad experience with the CMHT when I first became ill it changed my life completely and I ended up in hospital whilst in there I received great care and compassion and was discharged into the community where I ended up in a CMHT clinic which was the beginning of the downward spiral initially I was diagnosed in hospital with Psychotic depression and upon ending up in the clinic I was then given a new diagnoses after 6 months of BPD which once I was given this diagnoses it felt like I was cast aside and as though I was problematic little did I know after learning about this illness you are basically then stigmatized and I definitely felt a massive change from the way I was being treated before I have to say though not from the Doctor who showed me nothing but compassion and understanding but this came from the CPN who then started to visit me every 6-8 weeks and even then there were times they would phone me up and cancel the appointment leaving me angry and stressed as though I am irrelevant upon noticing the change in treatment I went to see GP and spoke to her who said she has come across this attitude towards people with BPD and said it's unacceptable even more so that it is coming from the CMHT itself not long after I was discharged and was glad because I wasn't getting any form of help and seemed to be just another number on the books my father then paid for me to see a private psychiatrist who was fantastic although expensive and he re diagnosed me with having Bipolar disorder and basically didn't agree with the BPD disorder I was given I was then placed on the right medication for this illness which I have noticed a massive change in my mood and outlook also my family and friends have noticed the difference too. Although I have a new diagnosis now I still feel terribly awful for those who can't afford to see a private psychiatrist and are given a BPD diagnosis because it completely invalidates you and makes you feel as though you are problematic and it affects you not getting the right support and help as other people who are diagnosed with another mental health illness. Also I must reiterate here although I was given a diagnoses of BPD by the doctor in the clinic he treated me with respect and dignity the less favorable treatment actually came from the CPN who did nothing to give me the right level of support or help and not turning up on appointed times and keep cancelling I think is completely rude and shouldn't be allowed to happen and going from visits every 2 weeks to then every 6-8 weeks and not even keeping in contact via phone is not right

WOW what a mouthy assistant, telling me that i only had 14 days to book, i said this is not on the letter, i was then called out to be a liar as i was told it was on letters. Well I have the letter here, MINUS anything about 14 days. So I am just waiting for my visit so I can show this letter.

Sticking to the covid Rules, there was 8 chairs in the waiting room however there was 40+ people just standing around waiting to be seen. Myself being one of them, I basically had to stand on 1 foot. After waiting 2 hours, I was sent in to have my X-Ray, the nurse cut my bloody bandage off and I had the x-Ray, she then Said and I quote ‚Äú Sorry, I don't have any clean bandages so I will have to put your old one back on‚Äù! I was then sent on my way to wait a further 2 and half hours where I was greeted to a fly hovering around my bloodied foot!

Went to check when I'd be seen as my son was becoming distressed and was told that the consultant had already left. She was called and I was told 'Sorry I have an important management meeting'. When I asked to be re-booked I was told that they could bump someone else from next week to fit us in. I'm still waiting over a day later for an appointment and am being given the run around.

7226,"General Medicine - Unprofessional staff - I'm leaving a review for the radiology department, specifically ultrasound. I had an appointment at 9.40am and I arrived at the main entrance at 9.30am. Was delayed due to mandatory COVID checks and questionnaires by multiple stations at the entrance. Had an elderly couple before me who had to be guided through all these slowly (not their fault!) which added more delayed time for me. Rushing to the ultrasound department labelled 'X-ray' not 'Radiology / Imaging' which confuses anyone trying to find the right door and gets stopped by another staff in HiVis demanding to see where I'm going adding more delayed time. The staff at the reception was nice but the radiologist came out the room telling me off for being late, comparing how other patient sitting outside to be called in managed to get here on time. Absolutely rude and pathetic behaviour towards anyone let alone a patient who has multiple worries about her health currently. I work in NHS with breast cancer women and I work closely with the radiology department. I know how busy this department can be but we are never rude to patients. Would avoid and tell friends and family to avoid this department at all cost. Cannot believe these are trained staff trusted with patient care. Totally not embodying the spirit of NHS. "

7136,"No emotional support during a crisis - I recently asked my CPN for a supporting letter to the council. She told me she was stressed. This makes me feel like I can't speak to her as I'll add to her case load. This weekend I rang crisis team I was struggling. No emotional support. Only told my CPN is calling Friday and they'll let duty team know to ring me Monday. If they don't ring by half 4, contact crisis to be chased up. I was asked if I had plans to act on my suicidal thoughts, I advised I did. Nothing more mentioned. Advised to sleep and that they're to talk. Monday came, no call from Duty team, tried ringing crisis team, no answer twice on maximum ringing length, rang them this morning (Tuesday) to be asked to ring the duty team, I explained this isn't my job to chase someone for doing the job their meant to do"
3402,Respiratory Medicine - Friendly staff - I had an appointment at 10:00am on the 7th of November and was seen by 10 past 10. My doctor was dressed very casually which I found very relaxing. He explained everything that I needed to know in a manner that I could understand. The appointment wasn't rushed and he gave me plenty of time to ask any questions that I had. I hope that I see the same doctor at my next appointment. The whole experience was very relaxing and as a patient I felt that I was very well looked after.
4952,"Wonderful, quick and efficient staff. Was in to have X Ray's, I was slightly delayed whilst the radiographer (Bill?) was trying to treat a youngster who was very frightened and upset. The care shown to the youngster was incredible. The hospital is everything you could look for....clean, friendly and rather old fashioned, in a wonderful way. You instantly feel as if you've been taken back to a better time."

8771,I was in ward 52 last week 02/09/20-from the moment I arrived early morning to the moment I left early evening-every staff member made me feel reassured and well looked after. Covid measures were very well enforced and I felt safe at all times. I think the ward had very recently been given some last minute changes to carry out-but they were all wonderful and always remained so calm and professional. Thank you xxx
35,The nurses and staff are absolutely wonderful. They go above and beyond especially under the current covid restrictions. I am sure the road to recovery for my mum will be alot better and speedier
1255,"Excellent facilities and nice, friendly, and experienced staff."
3266,1 definitely  The high standard of care from all the staff

6691,"They made me feel very comfortable - I went into the day center for an IV drip for my osteoarthritis. The staff were very friendly, helpful & kind. They made me feel very comfortable & explained the procedure to me carefully. All the staff were lovely & made it a pleasent experience."
863,"The doctors were fantastic and the nurses, very attentive and put me at ease. The only negative was the length of time it took to review my CT scan and have a doctor come and see me with results. I also had a nurse complain about me pushing the buzzer for help more than once even though I had a back injury and was told to stay still. But overall my first ever experience at the hospital was very good."
5566,Friendly staff mostly. Signage could be a little more clear for the imaging suite. Couldn't find it at first. But staff were very polite and patient in giving directions.
158,Cos everything was good n on time
4280,So very impressed - Just wondering if Emerg services know how much they are valued by the majority of us. Had experience of paramedics today and am just sooo full of praise for them. Did job brilliantly professionally but also with compassion 100 percent for our nhs ambulance team 
5341,An hour and a half late seeing Dr. with no apology or explanation. I didnt even get to see the Dr. so I couldnt get the answers I needed. A waste of time
7426,What was good?Everything.What could we do better?Nothing.

3559,Well unfortunately another surgery on the cards üòï but have to say a big thank you to @zafnaqui and his team at @SalfordRoyalNHS for looking after me. I'm in fab hands.üòÅ #arthritisisserious #earlyonsetarthritis #fabulousNHS
1078,"Most of the people there where lovely. When I was seen by someone (for the reason why I was there) they were kind, considerate, understanding, was able to explain to me what the issue(s) were in a way I could understand and they were able to answer any questions I had for them in the same manner. The only issues I had were the waiting time (not the hospitals fault nor anything that could be done to change that, apart from more funding to the nhs) and one of the receptionists was quite rude to me like I was doing something wrong or was demanding to see someone. I was just explaining what I had been told to"
5310,"Can you spare a prayer for Louisa and her family? Louisa is currently in hospital after a long life filled with good works & kindness, despite adversity. We give thanks for her & for the care she has @NNUH. Lord, please be with all that need you at this time. Amen. https://t.co / YspiAqJoxb"
2014,"Awful waiting times - My grandmother was taken to hospital in an ambulance to Frimley Park hospital... once getting there has not seen a doctor for over 6 hours and still waiting. She is 85, has serious dementia and was put on a bed and kept in the corridor. Not just her may I add, all the other patients too. My grandad (husband) is also in his 80's and completely exhausted. The NHS does a lot of good but these waiting times are absolutely atrocious. "
2157,"Great visit - Very helpful staff and got seen to as a walk-in within 2 hours. Might seem a long wait but with the COVID-19 pressures and everything I was pretty impressed with the way they're dealing with it. Promptly was seen and diagnosed, and fingers crossed on the road to recovery"
4592,"Children's assessment unit - Our six month old daughter attended Children's Assessment Unit yesterday and the care we received was nothing less than outstanding! The staff were fantastic and couldn't have been more caring. Warrington hospital should be proud of the Doctors, nurses, support staff and volunteers on the unit. This also mirrors the care we received in the maternity when our daughter was born in August. They staff were exceptional and so supportive. I couldn't have wished for better care. I cannot say a bad word for both experiences. Warrington should be proud of the staff that they have within the departments."
5163,If I could give dr bardi a zero rating then I would I was supposed to have major surgery but my blood pressure was too high the anesthesiologist said my blood pressure was too high and he was advising me not to have operation as he would not of been able to control my bleeding so basically I would of died so I refused operation and dr bardi was shouting at the anesthesiologist saying why did you tell him that so basically just avoid this consultant if you can as he was still wanting to do my operation
9271,Because I was painting there and earning a wage!!!! 
8644,"Dealt with efficiently and professionally by nice staff who were obviously very busy.
 | I do not think they could have done any better
The care was good"
9575,"Breast Surgery - Breast Screening - Today i attended an appointment for my annual mammogram, something i have done for the last 12 years, and experienced nothing but lovely, professional people in the department. Today was to be the exception! The radiographer who dealt with me was the most brutal and rude person. She had all the people skills of a brick wall and was not only curt and short tempered, but physically rough and aggressive. If this had been my first mammogram or i was feeling nervous or scared, she need to recognise that her manner is massively inappropriate. I've never come out of an appointment upset and emotional, and this person needs a wake up call."
9767,"Social.distancing and QR code - On a visit to the treatment centre I was early. While I waited I observed a lot of staff not observing the social distancing rules which I found very disturbing. One person ran down the stairs as a patient came up. I waited until this person reached the top before I made my way down. The person who ran past the patient then ran back up the stairs past myself. I also tried to find the QR code for my NHS app. I asked a receptionist only to be told that there wasn't one, after they had asked me what QR code was. I have been in lockdown since last March doing my bit to help the NHS. I was very upset by all of this."
210,"Five years ago today I was rushed overnight to CICU at UHS by ambulance from the RUH BATH. At 10.30 am the day before my Aorta dissected (type A). My surgery lasted 9 1/2 hours. I would like to say a really big THANK YOU to all the Doctors, Surgeons, Anaesthetists and most especially to all the Nurses on CICU who had to put up with my rudeness and bad behaviour. In my defence I would like to say that I was having hallucinations etc, I was incubated three times, so as to try to reset my brain. I was told that I wouldn't remember any of it but I do and am so ashamed of how I behaved. Five years ago today my life was saved by the fantastic staff at University Hospital Southampton. Once again I THANK YOU from the bottom of my (fixed) üíñ."
4715,Everyone so helpful. Felt very much in safe hands. Thank you to all the staff.
7360,"Professional and speedy clinical support - I have attended Heath Lodge Clinic on a number of occasions since 2010 and upon my recommendation so have other immediate family members for a variety of reasons but all requiring MRI scans. Our experiences have been of a speedy, efficient, helpful and caring nature from all those staff members we have dealt with from the professionally qualified clinicians through to the admin staff."

8748,"Orthopaedics - OPD CT Scan - My consultant organised a CT Shoulder, this arrived 2 weeks after my ortho appointment. I had my appointment and arrived 45 minutes early so expected a wait, taken straight in to change and then to scan. I was at home before my scheduled appointment time.

7396,"Gastrointestinal and Liver services - Care and communication first rate - All staff were wonderful before, during and after my colonoscopy procedure in the Clinical Investigation Unit. I felt completely safe and cared for at all times. Communication was first rate, everything was explained in a calm and reassuring way. I was discharged with a detailed written report which was very helpful. I felt no discomfort whatever and can't praise the nurses and consultant enough. I would add that the environment was very clean and every effort was made to be covid secure. Parking was easy. Thank you! "
5953,Maternity services - Excellent care during difficult times - I had my son at PAH a couple of weeks ago and was very impressed with the kindness and support I received. The birth was not the easiest and at times there were concerns about my son. Every time a decision needed to be made the midwives took time to explain in detail to myself and my husband and help reassure us. At times there were 5 or 6 people there to help us and respond to the situation. This was hugely reassuring and although covid meant I was alone on the ward I still feel everyone did what they could to support us and the other women they were caring for. Thank you for looking after us so well. 
4338,"Gastrointestinal and Liver services - Excellent service and procedure - I was very nervous and apprehensive about my procedure and was quickly put at ease by members of staff. They were all very kind, competent and caring. My overall experience of a not pleasant procedure was far better than expected. Thank you all"
3570,The staff were all very kind and supportive throughout. I was so pleased to have the opportunity to speak fully with the professor before my procedure. I thank him so much for having the time to fully talk to me - so reassuring.
8066,Very helpful professional staff and extremely clean and well maintained
7076,"Very unprofessional, unfriendly and rude receptionist!!! People with that kind of attitude MUST NOT WORK in healthcare, I'm a nurse saying this!! "
6340,Gynaecology - Ridiculous - Kept getting new letters in the post and each time I called they said it's a new appointment as I cancelled my old one which I hadn't cancelled! 
255,Got refused an appointment for a minor foot injury that needed looking at (on advice from 111) due to ReNoVAtIONs. Got offered Dursley or cirencester yeh cool if I had transport no further assistance was provided by them and the call was ended
404,"The Consultant and mammogram staff were so kind and reassuring, I felt very relaxed even though Id had previously been so worried about my appointment. Im very grateful for that."
135,"Amazing work - Ive been under western house several times. The service provided has not only supported me during rocky times amazingly, but helped me develop genuine love and compassion for myself. The staff, from reception (who are always kind, gentle, helpful and friendly) to the nurses, doctors, students and psychologists. They put you in the centre of the conversation, listen, and help. Thank you for everything you do."
2350,"Quick to respond, friendly and helpful."
3002,
2840,Don't know - Ultrasound Department - Thanks to the staff in this department for their friendly / caring attitude and to the Dr for the FNA carried out yesterday which was pretty much painless. 
5719,Student nurse Nicola (name) helped a lot and was kind.
1102,All staff were so caring with great professionalism. Thank you all so much!
38,"Staff were compassionate, made me feel at ease, kept me informed."
6632,I had a very bad injury in my knee and all my body. But in the hospital nobody ask if I'm ok or I need blanket or water.Waiting for someone from 6pm till 11.30 pm with big bleeding. I left this hospital 1.30am next day 25.12. without shoe and jakect. Nursery was very ignorant and nasty. Very bad experience
6230,I attended at the Derriford / Penninsulla Medical Ventre for a Colonoscopy and everyone was extremely helpful. I was looked after from start to finish.
6575,"I went here 2 times. First time I went for stitches removal and the nurse was amazing! Second time I went for a blood test and everything went quick and painless. Absolutely amazed by the service, especially since most nhs services are trashy."
163,I arrived early and was seen early and achieved what I needed to from my consultation
3013,1.very good  But could do with a leg rest and have two pillows otherwise very good  I need a leg rest which they didnt have at all in that ward. And the pillow was so very thin It needed another one for elderly people. There wasnt one to every bed I dont know why.
1140,the staff are very friendly and will always help you if needed they take an interest in you and do their best to make the patient feel happy
5540,Extremely caring staff - I had a cyst that needed treatment not once but 3 times. The staff in the Gynaecology team were always extremely caring and nothing was ever too much trouble. As mentioned I had 3 visits with general anaesthetic for surgery and I couldn't fault the care and compassion whilst in there care.
7846,"Accident and emergency services - More than 10 hours waiting in the emergency room - I arrived at the hospital at around 22hrs, did the preliminary checkup quickly, but then... I had around 15-20 people in front of me and it is 8:25am and I have not been seen by any doctor yet. That is, I have been waiting in the emergency room for more than 10hours. I tried to complain to one of the nurses and she just said the doctors are not able to attend the emergency. But how can they have time for the rest? Since the emergency is, by default, an emergency, they should have better time mngmnt skills. For the past 5hours only 2 patients have been called. Around 4am a lady which arrived around 9pm started to scream due to her ear infection, and nothing was done. She screamed for about 20min and none of the nurses did a thing, nor called anyone. This is outrageous. Additionally, the vending machines only have junk food, no vegan options, and the americano coffee came out as a tea. It is a pitty this is the only hospital in Bath, because it leaves no alternatives, so they can do whatever they like with their services."
6516,I gave you a 1. No further comment
5472,"PEOPLE PLEASE BEWARE Let this be a warning to anyone undergoing treatment Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust ‚Äì DO NOT DARE TO CRITICISE OR COMPLAIN. We got this message loud and clear. They will make your life a living hell! And your life is literally in their hands. They are like pigeons pecking an injured bird to death or bullies ganging up on the weak child in the playground, who should have known not to tell the teacher. You wouldn't believe how evil these so-called health professionals can be so please take care."
6719,"Every body so lovely and kind, very busy though"
1169,"This morning my 98 year old Mum fell out of bed. The ambulance crew who attended were reassuring, cheerful and did their best to make her comfortable and prepare her for a painless as possible journey to hospital. I'm afraid I don't remember names but think it was Neil, Mark and Lauren- thank you guys your help was so very much appreciated! "
7356,"The care I received from the get go was second to none, however when I was discharged I felt like I was being rushed off the ward and nobody asked if I needed to a chair to be wheeled to the entrance or even asked if I needed a hand with my bag. I was post-op and really struggled to walk down by myself - this really really let down the level of my care. Other than that, I felt safe and looked after during my stay."
5197,Excellent caring staff who were friendly. Procedure was impressively performed well done RSCH
6066,"Fantastic care, all staff really looked after my son. I especially want to thank Marjorie (name) as she is amazing at her job and looked after us with such care. Thankyou."

4868,All staff was very helpful and kind | None
1689,"Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery - Friendly staff - Two teeth extracted recently, nurses and dental surgeon very kind and explained what the procedure entailed. Did not feel rushed, plenty of time allowed for questions. "
7261,All nurses were very polite and helpful and always had a smile on and much more.
9537,"Drove my wife to Ashford hospital for out patient appointment. Sat in car park for hour and a half with a good view of the entrance. Like Picadilly Circus. As busy, if not busier, than pre-COVID. Also, last month I had appointmnet at same hospital - on a Saturday."
673,1
9787,"No COVID tests for people who might be operated on, my daughter spent 8 hours having tests yesterday then told she couldn't go until she had had a COVID test, they ran out of them in theLyme building and said they had ordered them from a&e, kept lying to her and 2 hours later she got up and told them she was leaving, bearing in mind they said they may need to operate, told her come back in morning, got there at 7.30 am as planned and still no COVID tests and results when they eventually get their act together take 4 hours, NHS royal stoke you are a disgrace"
7462,The quality of care and support of the team was really supportive and professional.
8711,
9609,
4525,I've said it before and I'll say it again; the surgeons at @RoyalPapworth are angels. My Dad had to have the same PTE op as Shelly on #surgeons and who knows if he would be here today without them. Thank you from the bottom of my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
7124,Lovely staff. Just the bed I was on the sheets were stained.
7508,Day treatment services - 5 star treatment - I had to attend on 18th March to have my Gallbladder removed. Having never even had a general anaesthetic I was extremely nervous. The process was seamless and I was kept aware of every step I had to take. Within an hour I had seen the Surgeon and the anaesthetist and was prepped for surgery. They immediately sensed my nervousness and put me at ease. I didn't cope well with the anaesthetic and was very sick for a few hours. The care and attention I received in the following few hours whilst in recovery was outstanding and for which I am very grateful. If I have one criticism it was the lack of information on post op after care. I wasn't really informed about changing dressings or when to see my Doctor etc. I would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this hospital. I received 5 star treatment. Thank you
7636,"This was my third visit within a year following a double cataract procedure. As always the system works well and the staff are helpful, courteous and cheerful. My doctor was informative and knew his stuff. Keep it up Ashford."

2372,1 very good  1 is the highest so can not do better than this
3296,Had to wait 3 hours despite of having an appointment. Worst experience ever
5654,"Diagnostic Imaging - Fantastic, quick, friendly and thorough service - I was referred for an MRI of the hip with contrast in December 2019 by my GP; I received my appointment quickly and was seen in February 2020. I attended the department and was seen by a consultant, a radiologist and a nurse. It was a thorough assessment beforehand and all the staff were so friendly and kind. Being a healthcare professional myself, it was strange being on the receiving end of care, but I could not fault it. I was quite nervous and they did a fabulous job. After my contrast I was transferred to MRI, the nurse made sure to pick up my Mum (who had come with me to the appointment) on the way to the department. The staff in the MRI were fantastic and explained everything to me (this was my first time having an MRI). I felt reassured and at ease throughout, even slightly relaxed during the MRI! All was completed within an hour and I was provided aftercare advice. Cannot fault the experience I had and the efficiency I experienced. Just wonderful. "
8810,"Orthopaedics - Substandard care. Disappointing - My father in law was admitted with pneumonia and ended up in the orthopaedic ward after other hospital staff at pinderfields left him for hours and gave him no choice but to leave his bed to relieve himself, resulting in him collapsing and fracturing his hip. Upon moving to this ward, he was left for hours a day with no way to get attention from staff, unable to move. My mother in law desperately tried to contact staff after he contacted her via his mobile phone, only for them to not answer after a 20 minute period and he ended up having to wait for him to be served his lunch to have the help he needed called for. He was in hospital for over 2 weeks and arrived home with HORRENDOUS pressure sores because no one moved him or provided him personal care throughout his stay. Covid or not; this is UNACCEPTABLE. We pay money from our taxes, he has paid money towards the nhs his entire life for such substandard care - pandemic or not, this is grossly inappropriate. The government are saying to protect the nhs- what? Because they are protecting the vulnerable? From this experience I don't believe they are. I am appalled at his treatment and find it truly disappointing that this is the level of care the nhs is able to provide: fund this hospital better as they clearly need more staff to provide care for their patients. Furthermore, they were going to deliver him home to an address that was 44 years out of date. Are records not updated with current GP details? Evidently not. We now have to deal with the massive repercussions of him going to hospital for care and leaving with more issues he went in with. Surely to god he should be coming home better off, not worse. Something is truly, seriously wrong with this system. It does not surprise me in the least that Pinderfields requires improvement. "
8685,Don't know - Poor - Why have a reception when there is no one there to assist you? I was also directed to Main Outpatients when it was a Bank Holiday! I could have been sat there all day. Not great for assistance. What I actually required was the Walk in Centre but I required a booking. I soon realised that I should give up and go home. 
9944,This is a horrible place. Stayed more than 4 hours in the emergency unit until doctor observe my wife. Very poor service. Never go to this place again for any emergency.
2986,Orthopaedics - poor practice - i walked in after seeing a registered sports therapist who diagnosed a possible compromised ankle joint. she ran ultrasound over it and it told me to go to hospital as a i may have a fracture that needs confirming. At newton abbot hospital I was met with dismissive male nurse practitioner who left me feeling belittled and gave me the impression he didn't want to know. I didn't get treated or have an x-ray i left feeling quite down. I know the NHS is busy but i didnt even get a look in. whats the point of having a local hospital if you are not going to treat the very poeple who pay for it.
4735,I would like to say a big thank you to everyone in B32 and in urology for looking after me today and keeping me Calm. Your all doing an amazing job THAMK YOU

2131,"Mi experiencia con este hospital y los m√©dicos es muy mala porque mi madre est√° ingresada ya m√°s de dos semanas y nadie hace nada. Todo se pasan la pelota uno al otro, que el m√©dicos, que la enfermeras y todo es que, que y que. Se que ten√≠a que hacer la resonancia y no se hecho. Llamaron varias veces a hospital anteriormente por su enfermedad que operaron y nadie visto nada tiene c√°ncer. Y lo que recet√≥ es cremitas. Se atienden entre m√©dicos y enfermeras en los cuartitos eso s√≠ que est√° haciendo bien y perfecto. Atenci√≥n cero, nadie explica porqu√© est√° que va hacer y lo mejor que nadie lo mira istorial que tiene. Cuando preguntamos para que se da tantas pastillas no sabe que responder nos dice que preguntemos a m√©dicos que tampoco lo vimos en todo este tiempo. En pocas palabras est√°n matando mi madre. Lo que voy hacer comunicar la prensa qu√© haga publicidad como se cuidan las personas mayores en esta hospital. Como recibe atenci√≥n las personas que no son de Reino Unido pero a ellos si por favor que cuando salgan en otras pa√≠ses que lo atiendan bien. Tengo amigos en la prensas pues sera f√°cil dar publicidad que sepa todo el mundo c√≥mo trabajan. Estoy muy enfadada."

1251,General Medicine - Five star care! Amazing - You'd hardly know there was a pandemic on so careful and attentive were the staff - from the nurse administering the pre-op Covid test to the gynaecologist to the anaesthetist and the pre-op post op and theatre nurses. I congratulate you all for going beyond the call of duty in making me comfortable. I was a day patient for a small operation and they made it all very easy. Thank you so much. You are all amazing

5327,"Accident and emergency services - Very good example - Amazing service from everyone involved when my 3yo son was couldn't catch his breath and turning blue, the paramedics were there instantly and so reassuring and confident, putting him at ease and treating him in the ambulance, got to hospital and the Dr's and nurses and support staff were all extremely knowledgeable and some working outside of their native tongue, super friendly and helpful making sure he was happy and comfortable, finding him toys and answering his little questions, they administered medicine and he was feeling better straight away. The service was so amazing I don't see how it could have been any better. Thank you so much to everyone involved. We felt safe in the hands of these healthcare professionals. I am constantly amazed by the patience and caring nature of our NHS staff, they and it are truly a blessing. Thank you. "

808,Know its too early for a Thank You Thursday but a massive shout out to the clinical trials team at all 3 @WorcsAcuteNHS sites! They're the most friendly people I've ever worked with and their patience and help over the last few weeks has been amazing üôåüèª
4968,Well organised once through the entrance which can be a bit of a bottleneck.
8049,Yesterday I saw so many acts of kindness and compassion that it reminded me the world still has good people. The paramedic that went out of her way to help a deaf patient @NWAmbulance and the medical sprs who as always just demonstrated what patient centred care looks like.
5963,Everything was in place to look after staff and visitors re Covid. I am always treated with a high level of care and respect from the opthalmology team.
8020,Another bad experience at RCHT. We attended today for a routine x-ray for my disabled child. We were informed there would be an hour wait. People should not be waiting that long in a waiting area at present. Departments should send a text or ring patients with routine appointments asking if they would like to rebook in these circumstances. Emergency work should be prioritised but people's time should not be wasted. 2 hour round trip for nothing! Both parents are medics so we DO understand but RCHT needs to improve its administration and be more patient focused! Text messages are easy to send...! 
3165,"Diagnostic Endoscopy - Friendly and efficient service - I attended this department for a colonoscopy and was so impressed by the service received both prior to the appointment and during the procedure. Routine procedures had to be suspended in April-May, but the nurses kept in touch about the reopening via several phone calls during those months. On the day, all went very smoothly and on time. All the staff were so friendly and helpful; this made a not-so-pleasant procedure very bearable (and it was actually pain-free). A lot of information was given throughout and appropriate precautions were in place regarding Covid. A big thanks to all the staff! "

471,"Accident and emergency services - Crisis team in Musgrove Park needs sorting - I went to Musgrove park hospital recently and was feeling suicidal. I waited more than 3 hours distressed and unwell mentally.in a cubicle It's hard to reach for help, but I found the courage to after a lot of thoughts. It was a never ending wait. I was then seen by a mental health nurse eventually. We talked abit then I had to walk home 3 half miles late at night, still mentally unwell and worse than when I had went in. very unhappy with this as was my family."
6250,"Will not give clear answers - My nonagenarian grandmother was admitted to hospital after a 12 hour wait in A&E. She is a strong active woman who came home weak, confused and frail. She is deaf and communication is difficult. Several of nurses I encountered seemed defensive and refused to explain what was happening to her. I appreciate they are under pressure but the family were often treated as a nuisance, despite the fact that we help her eat, use the toilet (changing her soiled clothes at the same time), and work out what she needs. We help her with her basic needs because nurses are busy or unavailable and are then told off 'for being in the way'. 6 beds are crammed into a 5 bed room, so there is nowhere for anyone to stand or sit when visiting (without being told off). The toilets are tatty too. A simple request to be present when the doctor visits became a point of conflict, a staff member simply said they'd call us - and would not respond to more questions. We have no idea if we would be called before or after - remember gran can't communicate well by herself, so we really needed to be present. They seem to forget she is deaf or can't communicate, it does not seem to be noted anywhere prominent. She is now confused and disorientated when she was never that way. I believe her health is worse. [Very unhappy with 'Staff attitude'] [Unhappy with 'Daily living support'] [Very unhappy with 'Seeing the whole me'] [Very unhappy with 'Being listened to'] [Unhappy with 'Toilet'] "
1161,"Been a patient since i was 3 years old. Im a patient at the Heamophilia centre. I suffer from severe Von Willebrands disorder which is a blood clotting disorder different from Heamophilia. Iv had 4 of my childrens birth here at St. Thomas the antenatal and labor wards including staff are have been brilliant, brilliant is still underestimating how good the Hospital is. Iv had nearly had death experiences and the Heamophilia team especially my Haematologist dr Bella Madan, she my guardian angel who goes well above her duties and care, to give me the best care anyone can provide. I live in Berkshire central and i go to central london to be cared for for all major non major operations and other health related care. Its the best hospital in the entire uk. Never have i been asked to give a review about the care iv received by the hospital. But today i realised that the least i could do is show my appreciation for all the hard work our drs and nurses give is. We are very lucky and privileged to be in a country where there's excellent care without a cost. So count your blessings every time. Zainab zafar"
5181,"Falling off my horse - I came off my horse yesterday on a bridge and landed on my back and my head. My friend drove me to ED in Treliske where I was triaged within 10 minutes of arrival, seen by a doctor within 5 minutes of being triaged and admitted to Majors immediately. I was given pain relief and had observations taken as soon as I was settled into majors by a wonderful assistant practitioner. The nurses, HCAs, porters and doctors were kind and thorough and kept me updated constantly. Someone checked on me every few minutes and continually assessed my pain. Being a nurse myself I am nervous about being a patient and the team in Treliske put all my fears to rest very quickly. My CT scan was done within 40 minutes of being admitted to majors and pain relief was optimised for this as I wasn't able to lie flat on admission. I was discharged with an information leaflet and extra pain relief to take home. I was completely blown away by the exceptional care I received all round."

9068,I went here once after going to bath ruh from falling off my bike. Bath ruh clicked my three dislocated fingers back into place and sent me on my way. After a few days of pain I went to Southmead where the underwent a thorough examination X-ray etc and found I had three broken ribs and a broken collarbone. I have just been to Southmead for chest pains. Again they were very thorough did X-ray and CT scan and found I had blood clots on lungs and an infection. Nothing was too much trouble and I owe them my life now.

3786,"Staff deserve a medal - All the staff at Broomfield Adult Day Surgey were amazing. Polite, friendly and so helpful on my recent stay for Oral Surgery.The hospital itself is so clean, comfortable and airy.The staff deserve a medal for their care and dedication."
1594,Disgusting treatment - I was supposed to have had a scan on 12th November but department phoned me an cancelled due to broken machine and the Dr sends me a letter stating I failed to show I'm absolutely enraged that they assumed I didn't show instead of communicating with other department.. I'm absolutely totally unhappy with the service I've been ill long enough without this and blaming the patient it's bad practice 
7634,"Communication poor - Poor communication (actually, no communication at all). The E-Referral website no appointments and no information on where your referral is going or what is happening - all causing anxiety. I would expect a letter or email (or even a note placed on the E-Referral page) saying what is happening, and the likelihood on waiting times and some sort of indication that if you have an urgent referral (non-cancer) on what is going on when you have tried to book an appointment. I have found out it is in triage but that doesn't tell me anything and I would hope that someone would have a thought that a letter to the patient would be appropriate saying what one is supposed to expect. Just to leave one hanging I think is not caring. "
2186,"Admitted with pneumonia/ sepsis difficulty breathing. All staff and doctors from triage, a&e, various scans and other test dept's were all brilliant. Those doctors and all staff on Medical 1 were exceptional with care equal to being looked after by family with added knowledge and professionalism. Even the food was good. Thank you all for my quick recovery Graham Symes room 12"

Based on the advise to increase the dose of my existing medication, we decided that I will get in touch with my GP to get the advised prescription so to collect the medication from my nearest pharmacy. GP informed that no communication was received and when I called the hospital, they said to collect from Hospital pharmacy. Not sure if they actually make a note of what is discussed on call. Also, I received my appointment letter after the date when appointment was due."

The staff were busy but concentrated on patients feeling relaxed and I would like to thank and congratulate all of them for providing a superb service."

I went for a pre-consultation about 4 weeks ago took blood heart monitor everything. The consultant I'm under says I have a very serious heart problem. I was booked for tomorrow 14th September (08.30). But today 13th September (12.18) they rang and said they had double booked, how could you possibly double book with a person who has a very serious heart condition? What is going on at this place? This so called hospital a place of care, needs to be investigated."

As soon as I called I was always greated with very polite ward staff who were always very helpful and informative. The quality of care was very good. I traveled 5 hours to see my partner and although I didnt book a visit they still allowed me a slot for a visit. Medication was prescribed on time. My partner was allowed out for a cigarette with me and a member of staff and she was also very polite and helpful. Highly recommended.

However I was prescribed the medication I would have taken after my surgery pending my procedure, which took place on the 30th December. I am now cancer free and would like to thank the teams at the Sunflower & Evergreen Suites for the fantastic service and care I have received. From attending my 'further tests' appointment, to having my operation, to receiving my pathology results and the good news and an excellent prognosis, all within 3 months, my expectations have been well and truly exceeded. The staff have been amazing and so caring, despite being under so much pressure due to covid. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. You are an awesome team. Stay safe. "

7476,I have full confidence in the nurse.
8116,"I use the outpatient departments a lot due to a long term condition, and must say that although they are incredibly busy, you can see that everyone does the best they can. There are one or two consultants who can be a little curt, but that may just be down to the number of people they see in a day. The parking is incredibly expensive however, which is not justifiable when you have to drive round for 20 mins or more to find a space."

I was asked to go back home even thou he was still in pain and asked to keep in on continuous capol medication until the find a date to have the surgery booked. The doctor has advised it not life threatening as it is okay for my son to be in pain for weeks until they find it fit for us to come in. I don't want to think I was sent home as a person of colour. Since I do not matter as a black person, my son's discomfort wouldn't matter to them."

7949,"Recent experience - Hello, I visited Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre for a face - to - face appointment in the outpatients department. I don't want to start with the carparking but I will - the payment pods weren't taking card payments only cash (tricky during a cashless covid!) and being cashless and with the card machine in the foyer out of service I had to park without paying - sorry about that. I think they've only been accepting cash for a few weeks so advance warning in the letter might be a good idea. The lady who worked on the outpatient booking desk in the foyer and the gentleman on the desk in the outpatient department were very polite and helpful showing me where to go. The Dr who my appointment was with was also great - good communication, very polite, asked if i had any questions and told me what would happen next. The only real negative was overhearing two staff members at a desk next to the seating area talking about a patient one of them had just seen which included detail of the test and how the patient wasn't right about something. I know staff need to talk about patients but perhaps if the conversation is going to include detail of how a patient was being a little bit awkward this shouldn't be done next to a seating area for other patients to overhear. Certainly made me feel like I wouldn't want to be seen by them if they were then going to discuss me in an open area afterwards."
7995,"It's about time this place was shut down, absolute horrific experience of west park I can totally agree with all of the bad reviews and probably still have more to say...how this place is still running is beyond me, please do not send anyone to this hell hole they will only come out worse."

Parking is difficult lots of little areas all busy, many people driving round trying to find spaces & I have found this on many occasions over the years we have visited different areas of this hospital. Though I can't see any solution to improving this due to where the hospital is situated."

7577,"Amazing experience. - Im writing this review for the gynaecology / colposcopy unit at alexandra hospital (redditch). Reason being is i was referred for a colposcopy due to an abnormal smear. I suffer terribly with anxiety and as a 29 woman its not nice to hear that let alone go through it. Safe to say i was very, very nervous and it may not be a big deal to some but it certainly was to me. I just wanted to say a big Thankyou to this team. I couldn't remember the names if i tried but the staff that were with me were exceptional. The consultant himself was lovely but the two nurses either side me feel relaxed and kept me chatting away to keep my mind off of it. That meant alot to me as my fear is nothing worse than awkwardness and not once did i experience this. What an amazing job your doing for these ladies, visiting a gyne ward as a woman isn't something you would ever want to do even with a positive results as the journey to that is daunting. If this does get past on i hope the consultant and nurses know who they. Thankyou "
8786,The staff members go above and beyond to help you get the correct diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible in a polite and friendly manner.  | The nurse doing the Covid-19 nose swab could have been a little more understanding of the patient instead of just trying to stick the swab up the patient‚Äôs nose and laughing when the patient complains about the abrupt nature it was being administered. 
5393,This one landed himself in A&E today what a bore BUT what amazing doctors & nurses getting the best out of a cranky 1.5 year old full credit to #torbayhospital and we got to go home üôåüèº https://t.co / tjDDTdNPev
7455,Cardiology - Very good Service but - All the personnel were polite and extreamly helpful. However the Consultant was hampered by an inability to access my medical records either from my GP or York Hospital. The booking system just states which hospitals you can use it does not explain that your medical records will not be available if you have not been treated at Harrogate for previous problems. Had I been informed at the time I could have obtained the information in advance of the appointment. This inability could lead to very high risk situations and wasts time and valuable resources at best. 
517,Exceptionally caring and helpful staff
9370,"hospital is great, the only problem you have is that since the new main reception has been built and the 3 new disabled bays have been allocated, not once in this time has a space been available and every single car / work van I've seen in the spaces has not been displaying a blue badge??? is this monitored by the hospital??? if not it needs to as those of us with restricted mobility have to walk a distance from surrounding areas."
7254,Staff Attitude
6550,"I was treated extremely well. Kind, caring and attentive staff.They listened and supported me when i was upset over being ill.I felt safe and was looked after throughout observations, blood tests, scans, washing.The staff on Compton Ward deserve a medal!"
8208,The Clinic ran very smoothly all aspects were fluid and I was kept informed
936,"Extremely helpful staff - My mum is under the care of the cardiothoracic service's heart failure nursing team. I've attended appointments with her and called them on her behalf. It's incredibly reassuring how insightful, skilled, thorough, organised, and excellent at communication they are. We are all very grateful to them. "
632,
3815,"By you helping mum it's made mum more able to help me - I just wanted to say thank you. We as a family have been through a lot these past 3 years with me and my health both physical and mental and we've always had to go it alone. Even when i eventually started getting support mum was left to cope with me, my emotions and my impulse behaviours on her own with no idea what to say or do. I'm so so glad she's had you for support. I'm getting better at not acting on urges but mum is now a lot better at how to react and help if something does go wrong. By you helping mum it's made mum more able to help me so for that alone I thank you. When things are starting to wobble and mum needs a helping hand you were always there and always said the right thing. I'm trying to get better and it's not easy but it's made that little bit easier because I know mum has someone to offload to and to talk things through with which I think is a major help. I remember being in an ambulance with the phone in my hand after an overdose thinking do I call mum or don't I? I was unsure she would be able to cope with yet another admission but now i know she has support it makes me being able to reach out that bit easier because I know she can cope with it. No one should have to cope with the things she's had to cope with but with your support she's been able to put that brave face on and do what she's got to do. She's been able to call for support or to ask a question about what to do etc. It's sad to hear you're moving on but I wish you all the best and thank you again for everything you have done for mum and for me. "
9734,The staff were very helpful and professional.
5092,"Don't know - Receptionist to radiology extremely rude - This woman spoke to my husband in a very rude manner and obviously had not heard if the word 'please'. I stood behind him and stated please aloud as I was so cross with the way she treated him. A nearby nurse nodded at me and put her thumbs up, she obviously felt the same. The front receptionist was also very abrupt! Very bad way to treat patients and needs addressing!! "
9083,I was seen following a dog bite and received such great and professional care. Thanks so much! 
6019,The staff were very helpful and friendly when dealing with my medical problem.
9749,"Accident and emergency services - Miscommunication - Telephoned 111 and got referred to First Response who booked us a time slot for a head injury and possible stroke. On arrival, one member of staff did not even want to listen to our explanation, and the receptionist said, that 111 and First Response say that to everyone you'll have to wait in the que outside, and there's a 6 hour wait just to be assessed!! Went home extremely worried."
8807,Absolutely appalling service my dad has been in there 8hours when he's up at 6am tomorrow its 11:30pm he's been there since 3:30 he's had nothing to eat nothing to drink he was told it was an emergency and he needed a scan 8hours and still no scan they won't say what's going on to anyone even him!!!!! 
7014,
2853,"Waiting time is ridiculous, not only because it's long but because they missinform you on the waiting time. Again I understand these are serious medical issues dealt with here, but for gods sake I waited two hours (that's roughly how long till someone would see me) just be told I need to wait two hours again. Again. Because. I appreciate they're busy but I could've gone home and waited on my bed in severe pain instead of lying on a ground by the hospital cause they don't have enough chairs and space to sit inside let alone social distance. This looks like a ghetto or a refugee camp, complete disgrace. Would have given zero if I could."
1335,Good care and politeness.
885,They were very good could no fault them many thanks

3628,"There was no communication. We waited for 2 hours to be seen by a dr in PAU only to then wait another 2 hours for the SHO and Reg to catch up with each other to finally get sent home. My issue is with the lack of information and not the fact the Drs are busy going to emergencies. The Drs were severely lacking in people skills. On the whole we were ignored [2et - feels like this is et if it were ignored in the not listened to sense, but in the we couldn't get anyone's attention sense, is that then FA]. Until the night team of nurses came in and at least introduced themselves and offered me a cup of tea."
7448,"Usually a fantastic hospital used for many years & they've always provided the best care when me & my family have needed it. I've been fortunate enough not to visit for a long time but tonight I needed looking at & they refused. My gp advised if it got any worse to ring 111 I rang 111 & they were worried and wanted me looking at, Shotley rang & fobbed me off back to the GP in pain with not even taking a look on 2 occasions. Not happy, a simple water test & looking at where the pain was coming from was all that was needed. Totally uncaring, unprofessional & if I'm honest lazy. Matt Hancock the nhs is there for whoever needs it well clearly not. Some health care professionals not all, I have great respect for the NHS having family and friends work for the NHS but I feel failed by this particular call handler / probably nurse as I think some deliberately try to fobb you off for an easy life or an excuse not to do there job properly."
874,RUBBISH COMMUNICATION - Hubby has a colonoscopy booked for tomorrow and when it was arranged we spoke to bowel screening who said that I would be able to be with him when he was discharged and they discussed the findings.Was told it would be documented that I would be with him.When I rang yesterday to confirm this I was told that this wasn't possible.Staff need to make sure they are giving the right information.
7055,"The spaces weren't to small, the instructions for payment were clear. When I returned to pay and leave the ticket was rejected by the payment machine but a short walk to a real person soon resolved the problem and I could pay by card. Thank you for not adding to the stress of an A&E visit."

373,"I was hurt badly by a patient but because I was conscious it doesnt mean anything to those who attended to me which makes me believe that one has to be unable to walk on his or her feet before nurses will accept that they are badly hurt.

4478,"MRI Scan - complete lack of confidentiality / dignity / privacy - I attended an MRI scan today and was very sad to see what I saw. 3 patients were at anyone time in the mobile MRI (container), 1 in the scan, 1 kept in the tiny changing cubicle (1metre x 2 metres with 3 lockers in there) siting on a chair (which is not being decontaminated at every use!) and finally 1 patient next to the nurses desk. This means that whilst waiting for one's turn, one can see the scan pictures on the nurses' computers (3 screens) as well as the name and details of person in the scan. One can also see the person, in the scan, in their hospital gown. In my opinion there was absolutely no concern from the staff for confidentiality, dignity or privacy. They were literally moving people one after the other like sheep! I was very fortunate that my scan was only for a limb so did not need to undress, but still, at least 2 other patients have seen by details and my scans... Not good at all! The lack of confidentiality awareness is very disturbing and shocking! "
987,Very professional and friendly. Everything explained well and I was put at ease. I would recommend.
8113,Very good attentive care
7481,"I was suggested by 111 to visit Homerton AE immediately on a Saturday night (28/8/2021). I have to say the wait time is not as long as I worried about and I could see the doctor within 3 hours. (I arrived at 6pm). The whole process was clear. The nurse has asked me the reason I visited, a while later the doctor has gave me a caring check up and explain how to resolve my issue. At the end when I finished and wanted to buy the medicines, The nurse are also very helpful to give me where I can find the pharmacy still open (because it was around 9:30pm already). I have to say my experience in this hospital is so much better than other AE. so I would give it high rate! "

2092,Excellent staff
532,I've been to Good Hope hospital many many times over 25 years. Both as a patient and being a support to a person or persons who have been patients at the hospital. And in all that time I have never once felt the care given by all the staff being anything but caring and professional. It has always been to a high standard. And this is from the domestic staff to all the doctors and nurses. So thank you one and all. You are all excellent! 
3091,"COVID DANGER Are patients aware that Covid negative and Covid positive, or those awaiting test results are mixed in wards? Are they aware that if a patient in the bay of that ward tests positive, or has had any contact with a Covid positive patient, they will be locked down with those patients with no visitors and unable to moe beyond their beds? My husband was tested on entry and after tasing negative was put into Victoria ward with Covid positive patients. There is no barrier nursing just disposable plastic aprons. I am beside my self with anxiety and have got no satisfaction from the hospital."
2875,"Friendly, caring and professional. Parking the only drawback "
6728,"Obstetrics And Gynaecology - Amazing staff - I went in all anxious and nervous and left feeling hopeful and cared for, even the assistant nurse was amazing, can't praise them enough"
2316,"Rating the booking system which is appalling... I was referred to ENT in January / Feb. 2021 and got offered my first appointment for August at a time I couldn't make so I called to reschedule and was given an earlier booking but no letter came to confirm, then I received a later one by post with again a date and time I couldn't make so asked for a reschedule by the text messaging system. One more time, was given by letter an August appointment date I couldn't make and called to reschedule (to end of September!!) and now being told that because I'VE CANCELLED so many times this is my LAST STRIKE before I must go back to GP to get a new referral... HOW UNCARING and UNPROFESSIONAL."
1124,"Cardiology - Outstanding - My husband was transported by ambulance to the hospital in the morning for a severe chest pain. Everybody was incredibly professional, helpful and kind - not only with him, but also with me. They did a lot of tests on him during the next 12 hours to understand what the problem was and they gave me regular updates of his situation. Everybody from doctors to nurses - including the lady at the reception desk who saw me worried and offered me a cup of coffee - has been so very kind. Thank you very much for your hard work and your support."
3685,"I decided to go here as when I turned up at QA was told there was at least a 2 HR wait. I was kicked by a horse and was worried about my arm. GWMH were absolutely brilliant. I was seen very quickly and given pain relief whilst there. Was x-rayed within half an hour. Thankfully nothing broken. Experience was quick, efficient and all staff were lovely. Thank you"
8172,Accident and emergency services - Not caring - Bringing my daughter in after being told by a doctor she may be suffering from blood clots after having covid 19 injections I was not allowed to sit with her as she is over 16. How scared she is is an understatement. Totally wrong policy by the hospital. Should have empathy and understanding but not shown by staff.

7095,"The hospital staff were very helpful and welcoming at the entrance as well as the staff who helped guide me to where I was going. The consultant I saw was very efficient, on time and explained exactly what would happen during my appointment time. It would have been helpful if the person who conducted the ultrasound scan had mentioned whether my GP would be sent a letter of the outcome of my results and explain this to me. I was impressed with the service and care given during my visit. A good experience. Thank you Royal Surrey, you are doing a great job."

6432,"Seeing dr, mammogram and ultrasound was all done really quickly and fortunately a happy result."
1682,It's tough to know where to begin on this so: My wife and I had a scheduled c-section due to the baby being breach. After a consultation we prepared for this and turned up to the hospital for the surgery. Before we went in a doctor came and scanned the baby and then forcibly turned the baby into the head down position without my wife's consent and hurting my wife in the process. This was the process discussed with the doctor earlier in the consultation and disregarded due to the risks. We were then told to go home as the c section wouldn't be performed as the baby was now head down. 3 days later my wife is readmitted in early labour with a urinary tract infection due to the position to the baby was turned into making it difficult to pass urine. Over the next day my wife developed into full labour with a baby being contracted into her infected bladder (peeing blood in a catheter) with just paracetamol and codeine for pain relief. To say the pain was intense would be an understatement. To see your wife scream at the top of her lungs with each contraction and then pass out from pain between then is a sight o couldn't wish onto my worst enemies. When she could finally be admitted to the labour ward the anaesthetist was in surgery so she had to wait another hour for the epidural with (again in advancing labour) with almost no pain relief. When the epidural was finally administered she finally had enough relief for the doctors to come and see her and disregard natural birth and send her to theatre for an emergency c-section whilst having an infection. Now our baby is on antibiotics due to her being delivered whilst my wife had an infection and my wife lost a litre of blood and can barely hold the baby to feed her. We still have to stay here for more days to get better and most of the midwifes just say the place is full and this just how it is and have no compassion even though I explain all of the above to them. Now starting day 5 of no sleep hoping my daughter and wife get better. Stay away from this hospital.
2406,"Maternity services - Amazing care - Following my ultrasound at the late clinic today. (05/01) I wanted to give some positive feedback to the wonderful technician. They were professional at all times, while still making feel at ease, not rushed, fully informed and like my care was paramount. Even though it ended with a slight issue that needs a pop up to DAU, the way it was all handled made this much easier to deal with. A huge thank you for making the experience what it was, it meant a lot. "

8596,I had a prescription north of 11. Mr Stevens and team could not have been more helpful and intuitive during my consultations. I had lens replacement followed by laser surgery and now have perfect vision. This has totally transformed my life and given me a freedom from glasses that I never thought I would have. I cannot recommend him and his team highly enough.
6663,"Don't know - A Centre of Excellence - I visited the hospital this week with a finger injury and was so impressed with the kindness and efficiency with which I was treated. I was greeted at the entrance by a very friendly and smiley nurse, who even remembered me from a call a couple of days earlier. I was registered, assessed and sent for an x-ray within 15 minutes and, because I am extremely vulnerable and had shielded throughout the pandemic, was given the option to sit away from the main waiting rooms. I had a short wait for my x-ray and almost immediately afterwards I saw a doctor who diagnosed a broken finger. The entire process had taken less than an hour and a half! All the staff I met, nurses, receptionist, radiographer and doctor were incredibly kind, courteous, helpful and efficient. It really shone out as a centre of excellence within our wonderful NHS. Thank you to everyone there."

Triage consisted of name number take a seat ( which there wasn't) standing room only. After 6 hours saw nurse / doctor for 1 minute sent to X-ray. Couldn't I be sent there at triage time as it was obvious I needed an X-ray? The waiting area reception staff and some other staff need retraining or get another job. Some people in the waiting room should not have been there. It is meant to be Accident or Emergency ( not A&E and can't be bothered to see my GP). And dont have an accident at a weekend.

3427,Very good doctors and nurses. The wait was extremely long and I and another person waiting for her treatment felt we were not kept up to speed and wondered if we had been forgotten.

On arrival at the department my husband was unable to park so dropped me off as close as possible. A lovely lady, who told me she worked at the hospital, assisted me and got my safely to A&E. I'd love to be able to thank this lady but I didn't get her name or even the department she works in. All I know is that she was waiting for her bus home after her shift and helped me for which I am very grateful. All the staff who dealt with me and my foot were lovely, caring people and explained each process fully and got me in and out in a few hours with my crutches and boot. I want to say a massive thank you each and everyone of them. "

3722,Cardiology - Excellent staff and bad staff - Why is it that in every profession you come across kind and compassionate dedicated professional people and the other few who spoil the good name of the NHS. In my opinion if you can't give 100 percent all of the time under pressure then I am afraid this is not the job for you their is no reason to be taking your frustration out with patients witnessed several times by myself. I am sorry if I sound blunt. But the NHS is a blessing to millions of people me and my wife would be lost without them to which we are both truly thankful just such a shame for the few staff who really don't want to be there.

READ MORE: Chaos as former Vote Leave chief tipped to become PM's chief of staff Last night he was understood to have handed the Prime Minister his resignation and will leave his role before the New Year. Tories backbenchers turned against the top aide blaming him for the Conservative Government's chaotic handling of the pandemic which has left the UK having the highest Covid-19 death toll in Europe. Health experts also blamed Johnson's failure to sack Cummings over the aide's lockdown breaches to Durham in April as weakening compliance in the rules among the wider population.

Asked why Johnson's chief adviser will be departing, Shapps told Sky News this morning: As he wrote right at the beginning of the year in his own words, he planned to make himself largely redundant this year with the big thing that he worked on, of course, which was Brexit, coming to an end at the end of the transition period, which is December 31. Of course, the other big thing is helping to ensure we have the roll-out mass testing to defeat this virus. Both these things are on the near-term horizon now."

894,"I have been going to the QE2 urgent care department for post-surgical wound dressings between once and twice a week for nearly 4 months now and I cannot fault them. I think I have been seen by most of the nurses there by now and they are all competent, efficient and also generally lovely people. At my first visit there were complications after my surgery and I was very anxious and upset but all of the staff really helped to put me at ease. I have never had to wait longer than two hours and am usually seen in under one hour. Of course sometimes people who arrive after me could be seen first but I take it that this is due to seeing people in order of severity. There is a separate children's waiting room which I think is very helpful for both the children and adults. The department is also dealing very well with covid regulations with seating in the waiting room set far apart and patients asked to sanitise their hands regularly and change their face masks. I cannot praise the staff here highly enough, from those working on reception to the nurses and paramedics and GPs, as well as the security staff."
5429,"AMAZING Response & Help - I would just like to say a massive thank you to the 3 ladies of the ambulance crew that attend our home on Friday 06/11/20 to treat our 2 year old little boy. The whole situation at the time was a nightmare as I received a call at work from my partner advising her Mum (The Mother-in-law) who is our primary childcare provider was panicking over our little boy as he had fallen over and wasn't well. My partner was now also panicking and emotional and both her and I were at work at least 30mins away. The biggest issue being the Mother-in-law doesn't speak English. I rang 999 and requested an ambulance but was in Essex and speaking to the Essex ambulance, they requested the Mother-in-laws phone number to get a translator to help and organised the ambulance in Kent to be dispatched to our home. I immediately left work at the same with extreme worry of what I was going to arrive home to find. Upon arriving home an ambulance crew were there and in full control of the situation. Our Son had fallen over in the house and banged his head on the tiled floor and through shock turned blue and struggled to breathe for a short while and then was concussed. The 3 ladies of the ambulance crew were AMAZING, so professional and caring and after a full set of checks took myself and our son to Pembury Hospital for a check over with the doctor. I have not had many instances of requiring an ambulance but the service we received was 5* and I truly wish to thank the 3 ladies who came and helped, THANK YOU! "

I had a known ovarian cyst from a previous scan. I had to reiterate that I was in a lot of pain and was eventually sent to GUA. I had a pelvic exam and swabs taken but basically told they don't know what it is causing the pain and sent home with pain killers.

3541,"Breast Surgery - Outstanding care - thank you - I wanted to feedback and say thank you for the outstanding service and care I have received at RSCH. I was referred to the Breast Surgery team for the removal and replacement of a leaking breast implant. I had the implant almost 22 years ago following a mastectomy and reconstruction to treat breast cancer. I was seen by the Consultant in January for my first consultation with an audio follow up in April and another in-person consultation in July. The Consultant booked me in for surgery in October. At each consultation she was friendly and approachable and very clear and helpful about the surgery I would need. I felt very comfortable and safe in her care. I was invited for surgery in the Elective Short Stay Surgery Unit on 19 October. I had very clear and helpful letters, messages and phone calls to book me if for the various pre op preparations. I was seen by a very professional and caring nurse for my pre op tests. The male nurse who did my pre op Covid test was again professional and caring. On arrival at the ESSU I was checked in and shown to my bed. I was very lucky as I was first on the list. From that moment on there was a steady flow of visits in preparation for my operation from the Anaesthetist, the Consultant and the ward nurses. Everyone of the staff introduced themselves and explained what they were going to do. I felt included in the process and discussions. In theatre the Anaesthetist was calm and gentle and the next thing I knew I was in Recovery. The nurses there were excellent and sat with me for a while and ensured I was okay. I was checked on regularly and soon moved back to ESSU where the care and checks continued. The drugs for me to take home were prepared and ready and by 14:00 the nurse had arranged for my husband to pick me up. I could not have wanted or needed better care. I appreciate I was lucky to be first on the list but the whole operation could not have been smoother. The staff were absolutely amazing. I am truly thankful for an outstanding experience! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Please share this with the ESSU Team and the Theatre Recovery team. "

2613,"Don't know - Covid-19 -My experience - My name is Kathleen Burt and this is my story. I ended up at Medway Maritime after a phone call to 111 who immediately sent an ambulance who took me to Medway Hospital. Going back a bit a few days before I had had a test which came back positive for Covid-19. I was told to go home for 14 days and stay here. About 8-10 days into the stay at home I started having high temperature and other symptoms which I had never had before, like loss of smell and taste. I phoned 111 and in 10 minutes I had an ambulance outside my house. I was taken to A&E and spent the night at the A&E Ward. The next day in the morning I was taken to Tennison (???) Ward. Spent a couple of nights there and was then sent to Jade Ward and then to a private room within Jade Ward where treatment continued non-stop. Doctors and nurses always attentive to any change. I have no words to explain how thankful; I am to all the staff - in fact the word thank youdoesn't exist for what the Doctors and nurses do In those wards. They give their all to the patients. In my view they are angels in disguise.. I was there altogether for about 10 days (I am not exactly sure) - by the way: who says Hospital food is bad? The food is very tasty at Medway Hospital ..... What else can I say about the Doctors and nurses in Tennysson (???) Ward and Jade Ward - (I am not sure where their strength comes from). They are special people and as I said above they are angels in disguise and this includes all of them, the ones serving our breakfast, and all the cups of tea through day, the staff puffing up our pillows to make us feel more comfortable. I dont know what else to say and I will be forever thankful to hem. I am home now and continuing to recouperate and whenever I think of my experience at Medway Hospital I have a big smile on my face. My story was a success story. Thank you guys!!!! "

4898,"A credit to the department - A few weeks ago I took my friend to an eye appointment. Once booked in we were called in to a small vision bay. The staff member introduced himself and explained what he was going to do. My friend was very nervous, but he took his time and made her feel at ease. Before anything was done he explained the steps (vision test, pressure test, dilating drops). Once finished he sent us for scans. Whilst waiting for them the lady who was doing them ask if he could cover her for a bit so he ended up doing ALL our tests ready to see the doctor. It was a very busy day and we couldn't believe how many times he came out to the waiting room to call another patient. He worked tirelessly the whole time we were there and always with a smile on his face. This staff member is a credit to the department"
6238,As with many others where does the managment get the idea that 5 hours wait is acceptable. Recall that it's been like this for many years so it's nothing to do with the current situation but a lack of understanding of the needs of the people and a lack of ability or will to change and provide the services that are needed. It's a clear indication of poor management that they have to have staff capable of handling complaints and a waiting room and car park. If they has the correct balance of medical staff to incoming patients then they would not need these things.

I didn't see any equipment or shared facilities cleaned in the time I was at the hospital (8 hours) and in the triage room the nurse used the observation machine on me (blood pressure etc), however, it wasn't cleaned before or after use and another occasion when my obs were checked the machine wasn't cleaned after use. The triage nurse was nice but there was a bit of a language barrier and she asked me to take my mask down and partly took hers down so she could understand what I was saying. "

170,"Haematology - Blood Test Issue - Attended on 3 February 2020 at 10.50am. 52 people in front of me, I waited 1.75 hours. I appreciate they are busy. When I went in the lady taking my blood didn't even look at me or ask me to confirm I had not eaten since last night (it was a fasting blood test) or advise when the results would come through. I politely mentioned I had waited 1.75 hours. No response at all. I was grateful to have my blood test but do not appreciate being treated as if I do not exist. Finally, I am not too sure why I am leaving this review as St Margarets do not respond to any reviews, be they good or bad. Why not? "

7081,Let's shout my medical history to the world - Just returned from a terrible experience at the breat screening caravan. My personal information was shouted out for anyone to hear until I said I don't think this should be shouted out so they took me in. The whole experience is one I am not likely to repeat in a hurry. No pleasantries even though everyone is clearly stressed your not made to feel any better. 
4097,"A very professional consultation, very reassuring."
5899,Confusion with the appointment. We were told it was a telephone consultation- twice. Then on the day of the appointment a letter arrived saying we had to go to the hospital at 14.00! It was noon when the letter arrived! Rang the appointments dept and was told definitely telephone consultation then the Oncology nurse rang to say we had to go into the Stokes Centre. Total confusion by all concerned. We have also received an appointment for a telephone consultation with Mr Sood on 17/07 at 10.00. I have been assured this has been cancelled. We will wait and see. On the medical side the RSCH is excel

7975,"Disgraceful - Having visited Fieldhead last year after reaching rock bottom I was then fobbed off with the usual talking therapy nonsense. This year was referred by my GP and went through the same old rig moral once again only this time it was over the phone. Waited for the after meeting phone call and once again, fobbed off by a so-called mental health professional who decided without even speaking to me that I couldn't receive medication. I have since complained and am considering going to the local press. It seems that unless you're foaming at the mouth the only thing that's offered is talking therapy which does not work for everyone. The sevice (or lack of) provided for people with certain mental health issues is absolutely disgraceful! "

We had to go round the back of the hospital park in the road and pay. On a chemo day we can be there for hours. It is going to cost us a fortune. Is this right.

6515,"The only person nice to me were the two ladies who welcomed me and the nurse who waited with me before the doctor called me in. The while experience was traumatic. Lets start with the most important part, for the last 9 moths now I have a horrible breast pain (the left one to be exact), followed by a lump which appeared 6-7 months ago in the centre of the left breast. After my Gp's super bombastic examination, she said it could be cancer and off i went to the breast cancer clinic.The time came, 25th of Feb! Here I go, scared and not sure about anything, terrified but somehow relived, knowing i will finally know, the answer to my misery is coming. I was happy knowing a ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù will see me, reinsure me and help in every way she / he can cause it is at the end of the day cancer. Little did I know that my doctor had other plans. Instead of calming voice, she was literally raising her voice. Instead of reinsuring me, she patronised me. Instead of proper body examination she decided to touch me as if i was made of glass and she was afraid i would fall down and break Instead of her listening to my worries and decided to talk over me. Instead of her literally listening to me she decided to only listen to what she wanted to. Let me give you some examples of our conversation (before the examination) D: ‚Äú your breast hurt because you eat dairy‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúOh i am allergic, i dont eat dairy‚Äù D: ‚Äùyou do and thats the reason‚Äù - while rolling her eyes D ‚Äúyour breast might hurt because you drink alcohol and caffeine‚Äù Me‚Äù My dad drinks a lot, hens why i dont drink alcohol‚Äù D: ‚Äú Its the caffeine‚Äù which i dont drink Me ‚Äú My breast hurts for 9 months hens why i went to my GP 2 weeks ago‚Äù D : ‚ÄúYour GP scared you, this is why your breast hurts‚Äù Me ‚Äú NO i said 9 months like 5 times now‚Äù D : ‚ÄúAnyway, young women dont have cancer, its rare‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúBut it happens, I can be the rare one‚Äù D: ‚Äúyeah but no‚Äù The woman was literally a disaster, nothing was done for me. She spoke to me as if I was 15 and she had to babysit me and feed me with nonsense to kill time. While patronising and refusing to let me talk I could see this patronising smile on her face, despite her wearing a face mask (way too small for her face) it wasnt hard to see what was underneath. I was in there for like 4-5 minutes, she was rushing me and i literally couldnt say a full sentence, she rolled her eyes once when i spoke about my dairy allergy and criticised the fact my mother doesnt talk to me about her health issues - as if this was any of her business! A lot happened in those 4 minutes, I left crying and confused. I had no answers, She said she can do an Ultrasound but only for my peace of mind if i am ‚ÄúLike that‚Äù - what ever that means but reinsured me she wont be looking at the results. What's the damn point then? Plus I was advised by my friend who is a womens health Doctor and a surgeon who treats cancers for women etc that ultrasound wont detect cancer based on pain etc. Only biopsy, MRI and momogram but MRI is the best way to see cancer at either early or late stage. Well, she declined all and reinsured me (the best part) that despite my grandmother and my mother having breast cancer that its NOT relevant and its simply nothing to worry about - wow, so smart isnt she? Like, I almost believed that i am a drunk addict who loves eating cheese, she is that good. NOT The whole experience was traumatising and i now understand why so many women die of cancer in the UK. The health system is a joke, really sad true, no jokes about that. I still have no answers which is why i will be bombarding my GP with calls tomorrow and demand biopsy or MRI based on her referral. Doctor wannabe used the fact i was vulnerable and saw an opening and decided to treat me like trash."

1376,Cataract Surgery - Cannot thank you enough - I am 90 years of age and only have one eye. A few years ago when my remaining eye became severely affected by a rare Christmas Tree cataract my standard of Life began to deteriorate as everything became cloudy and I was severely affected by sunlight. Having been told by my local clinicians that it was best not to do anything until I was almost blind (so I had less to lose if the operation was not a success) I put up with things. Last year I decided to ask to be referred to Moorfields. What a difference. From start to finish they put my mind totally at ease and after a sucessful cataract removal in December 2020 I can now see perfectly well with my one eye and my Life has been totally transformed. I CANNOT THANK YOU ALL ENOUGH. YOU ARE ALL WONDERFUL AND GIFTED PEOPLE.

I've had scans and no real results. So many things hidden / blamed on covid when all the steps are in place to protect from it. It's not good enough, mine and I'm sure others health is at risk, sumthing needs to change‚Ä¶ fast"
9005,"Accident and emergency services - Disgusting - I attended the A&E department having been sent by my GP. I was in a very anxious and upset state and was very worried about my health / condition. On arrival we saw a paramedic (rude man not wearing a mask), the first thing he said was ‚Äòyou can't come in sir! ' to my husband, while waving his hand in a rude manner. I fully understand the covid rules and why my husband wasn't allowed in but this was totally unnecessary and unprofessional. He then said ‚Äòwhy have they sent you here? You shouldn't be here.' He sent me to another door saying they probably wouldn't see me. At the second door, zero covid compliance was in place; no masks were worn by door staff. I had to request to sanitise my hands. Many staff standing around talking; some even watching the football on their phones. Triage nurse was rude and ignored me, doctor didn't know what to do with me and walked off leaving me in the cubicle for an hour and a half. The cubicle had blood on the floor and examination couch, which did little to ease my anxiety. A good clean wouldn't go amiss! Staff didn't know what was going on with / for me as that doctor had then finished his shift. I was put in another waiting room where zero covid restrictions were in place. I felt very unsafe covid-wise and was in a lot of pain and feeling very anxious. Where is the care? Absolutely disgusting. I know that these people are busy but honestly this was a horrendous experience. I am a human being who was in pain and distress. If this is the treatment available, it's a very sad state. I will never attend this A&E again. A waste of 5.5 hours of my life and 5.5 hours of pain, anxiety and discomfort for absolutely nothing. I've had to return to my GP to be referred to a different (hopefully better) hospital. "

9088,"I have recently spent 11 days as an inpatient at Musgrove Park. My last experience as an inpatient here was 15 years ago, and it's clearly nowhere as good as it was. Some of the staff were absolutely brilliant, some were awful. For most of my stay, I was the only person in the bay who was independent. Others were bed bound, some had dementia, some both. I was told on day one that because I was independent, I would get very little attention. Some of what I saw and experienced genuinely worried me. There were three occasions when I was not offered food because my record had not been updated from clear fluids only or nil by mouth. Only on one occasion did a switched on member of staff notice and go and get me something. Food was not always good. One salad consisted of a few bits of lettuce, one slice of tomato and two slices of cucumber. I had curry that arrived still in the microwave tray. In another bay, two patients who had ordered vegan sausage rolls, had to have their food returned as apparently they were virtually uncooked. I was asked by one nurse to provide stool samples as I had internal bleeding. The first sample was checked and logged. The second occasion, I told the nurse looking after me that day that this is what I'd been asked to do and I was heading for the loo. She asked me what I wanted her to do about it and if she or I were going to clear it. After two and a half hours the unchecked sample was still there, so I disposed of it myself. When the nurse was asked if she'd taken a sample, she said 'no'. She was then asked if she'd looked at it and she said 'yes' and went on to give the description from the previous record. Since this bore no resemblance to the second sample, it was clear she'd flat out lied. I could also see the loo door from my bed and I know she never went in there. One two consecutive mornings this same nurse failed to give me one of my tablets, as they didn't have any on the ward. I doubt any action was taken to get more sent up from the pharmacy. My personal bed space failed a cleaning check. I had a cannula left to get very bloody, and the other at one point was incorrectly taped to my skin. One day an obs round was missed for the entire ward. I saw dementia patients crying to be taken to the loo and weren't, and then left to sit around in wet incontinence pads. These are just some of the things that happened. Sleeping was impossible. The doctors were great however, and I know the staff worked 12.5 hour shifts and it was non-stop for them, so I do have sympathy. But this is no help to patients. I think if you're only admitted for a day or two and are lucky enough to have great staff on those days, then you're likely to rate the hospital highly. Spend any length of time there and see the full spectrum and it's a very different picture. I'm posting this review in the hopes that someone within management at the hospital will see it and address these issues."

8261,"Neurology - Amazing care in challenging times - I had an operation for a brain tumour and when this was starting to grow again a gamma knife treatment. Therefore, I'm still under observation. I had my MRI on February 11th and an appointment with the consultant or one of their team on the 24th of March. Because of the coronavirus crisis I phoned and asked if I could get the result by phone or email instead of having to attend the clinic of the consultant. On the same day they phoned back, shared the results in a very caring and thorough way over the phone, cancelled my appointment and booked a checkup in two years' time. I was very impressed by the efficient and quick reply and I am extremely thankful I do not have to travel to Haywards Heath with the very real risk of infection. It's a great thing if someone has the ability to think outside the box in times that are as challenging as they are at the moment."

It was a busy day but I was constantly treated by positive friendly people efficiently doing their jobs and giving me all the time needed to explain about my injury. Medically they diagnosed my severe calf tear by re-examining my injury after removing a cast and giving me a boot instead. The A@E and orthopaedic doctor that attended to confirm my diagnosis were great. Thank you to all the people who made my trip a positive one.

8219,I would like to thank all staff in the Day Treatment Unit as well as the surgical team for their amazing help yesterday. Although my surgeon was unexpectedly off my surgery went ahead due to another surgeon cancelling his plans meaning some of his surgeries were still able to go ahead. You were all excellent and compassionate and really put me at ease both before & after my surgery. I would highly recommend this hospital.
1927,"Cataract surgery - Had excellent service, couldn't hope for better. All the staff that dealt with me were friendly and pleasant doing their best to put me at ease. Coffee, and sandwiches were provide which were very welcome. The theatre staff and surgeon were exemplary putting me at ease. I was asked what music I preferred which was a nice touch. I was very anxious about my operation which turned out to be much better than expected."

I would be like a cold stone thrown on the road, the wind would pass through me like time now! Without you, Lord, I would not know love, the beating of my heart would be like the clock that beats in vain! I would be without the power to dream very beautifully, with the indifference of being in the night of happy stars! Without you, Lord, I could not look at all the flowers, the moments of love would not be so rich! I would be dried up by the words of my being, I would be the silent voice that descends the day from the stars! Without you, Lord, I would not know the magnitude of your power, I would look at the sun like a flower without petals!

1646,General dental treatment - Great practice - I had an extraction today and was very pleased with the process . The dentist was very professional and reassuring which helped as I am a nervous patient. The practice was clean and covid safe.
2750,Accident and emergency services - Excellent staff. - Same day emergency day care unit. I have nothing but praise for the empathy I was shown during my recent experience of this department. What a credit the staff are to their profession. From the domestic through to the Dr's and all the other professionals I came into contact with. The care was exceptional and the staff went above and beyond to ensure I received optimum care. I was kept well informed of what was going on and nothing was a problem. They recognised that I felt very unwell and was monitored regularly throughout the day. I was informed on discharge of my follow up appointment. I witnessed other patients being tret at all times with dignity and respect by all of the staff who were very knowledgeable. Even though the unit was busy it was ran with great enthusiasm and you could tell staff were happy on their roles. A credit to Sunderland Royal and an excellent service provision. I can't remember individual staff names but as a team they were outstanding.

1065,"Plenty of spaces....first 30mins free, thereafter a fee."
3031,"Caring A&E visit - I visited A&E today with my child following a cut lip trying to stand at the television unit. The department was extremely busy (70 or so patients at one time) and I noticed the entire time that every member of staff was calm and approachable. We were triaged and the nurse was lovely, asking all relevant questions and giving my child paracetamol as I didn't have any because I was in a rush to get there. We then waited to see a nurse who explained that they would speak to a member of the facial surgical team and at that moment the surgeon came. She explained the options for my child thoroughly, resulting in me getting upset as they had mentioned possible surgery. The senior nurse, surgeon and play therapist were all extremely caring and compassionate, taking myself and my child to a quieter area and getting some toys to occupy them, and even offering me a hot drink or some water. We then waited for my child to get treatment and the nurse was extremely patient with her as they weren't too happy about having steri strips put on. The play therapist was helping all the while by singing to them. We were then seen again by the surgeon and they spoke again about surgery and clearly telling me the pros and cons (I decided not to as the risks outweighed the benefits.) I would just like to take the time to thank all of the staff that were on today (I don't remember names unfortunately, it's all a little blurry) and let them know that even in these testing times they are incredible and we are very grateful for them."

The staff are entirely unprofessional and try to rob you of any choice in anything. One Dr in particular tried to give me medication I can't take which would have made me seriously ill.

2120,"Really bad experience!! I have been there on Friday for a cyst and was sent to the Surgery Department as the cyst was in a delicate part of the body (the neck). The doctor also prescribed some medication and, he said, sent the prescription online to the pharmacy. I went to collect and had to wait half hour outside (freezing!) to find out that the doctor forgot to send it! I had go to him again, wait, and finally I've got my medication. Basically, I wasted a morning. Moreover, ... I was told I had a surgery today at 12.45 pm (Monday 8th of March) and had to arrive around 11-11.30 am. When I was at the Day Surgery Centre the receptionist said they didn't have my name. It took a while to find me. (I was waiting outside, freezing) They sent me away as it was too early, I couldn't wait inside, and they said I had to come back at 12.30 pm. I couldn't get in until that time. I was wondering why as I was told to arrive 1 hour/1 hour and half earlier. I asked for an explanation and I was told that 12.45 wasn't the time I had to go on surgery but the time I had to arrive to do the check etc. However, I went back at 12.30 and they came to pick me up at 1.30 pm! I had to wait till 15 pm before going to surgery!! No way!!! "

4230,used to be good but now are dreadful. impossible to access. all the doctors have ran away when other surgerys have reopened. can only get phone consultation and that is very difficult. they are on full pay to run away. very hard to get your prescriptions.
9881,"Excellent advice, support and treatment - I cannot thank the Old Cottage Surgery GPs enough, without their advice, support and treatment things could have been very different for me. What I thought was a bad headache after working from home For long periods, and requesting a phone appt for stronger pain relief, I spoke with a GP within 2 hours of the request. They redirected me to A&E where I was subsequently admitted for a week with bacterial meningitis. Following discharge I had a number of difficulties in the weeks after this with my health, again requests for appts made and never more than 2hours before I received a call with further advice and treatment, requiring a further admission to hospital. Without their knowledge and skills In such a timely manner I fear things could have had a drastically different outcome for me. There was a continuity of care, my request always seemed to be allocated to 2 GPs who knew my situation and I did not have to repeat the whole situation to again. Their online system for sick notes is easy to access and reduced to pressure of needing to attend the surgery. They were supportive around taking time off work and I felt under no pressure or judged for requesting some additional time off work. I'm so very grateful for all of the contacts I have had with the GPs within the surgery, although some prefer and require face to face appts, the system of telephone consultation, in my case, was very beneficial. It ensured a quicker response on all occasions and with the same quality of advice and overall outcome / recommendations. "

7730,"Neurology - Gratitude - On April 14 my husband and I had to wait five hours for hospital transport after an appointment at the Neurology Clinic on the first floor. My husband is nil by mouth and needed a water flush. The Senior Sister quickly organised this and regularly asked if she could do anything for us. The receptionist told us that our driver was lost somewhere in the building and went to search for him and eventually found him on the tenth floor. He was very apologetic. The two members of staff mentioned went more than the extra mile and I would like to commend them both. I would like to add that in my opinion the kindness and concern of the Senior Sister was outstanding and brought out the best in all her staff. She is a credit to the NHS. As we left, the receptionist gave me a bag with a sandwich, juice and orange for our journey back to my husband's nursing home. He had clearly enjoyed the whole experience after being in his room 24/7 for most of the last year. "

They visited my home initially, speaking to myself and close members of my family, giving support and reassurance at a time when I was at my lowest. They visited daily until, by agreement, the visits were reduced to twice weekly and subsequently I visited the team on a weekly basis at Highbury Hospital out-patients department. My family and I felt that we were supported by kind, caring individuals, who were available at the end of a telephone at any time of the day or night. Their professionalism was always evident but was backed up with excellent interpersonal skills which I found both calming and reassuring. I have now been discharged from their care as I continue to recover but I and my immediate family cannot praise the work and dedication of this team highly enough."

4805,"I was laid on a bare mattress since 9:15am as my sheets were covered in sick and blood. I've asked 8+ times to 6 different staff if they can make my bed, it's only because of my cannula position or I would do it myself. So bloody awful. Only just done it now. @NTeesHpoolNHSFT"

1077,Strange place. Absolutely stinks of the landfill site that is really unpleasant if you feel Ill. MRI department is deep in the dark basement down a narrow staircase. But the staff are lovely and they were very caring towards me. It's a huge place so give yourself time to find the right wards / clinics.
1680,.@HPFT_NHS You have let us down so badly. You have let our 15 year old daughter down so badly. We now have no choice but to get private psychiatric help for her because #camhs wont do it. WE WILL BE BILLING YOU and WE WILL BE TAKING THIS TO THE NEWS @jonnyl1973
5221,Staff are friendly and courteous.
7955,i have been treated amazingly all the doctors were lovely and the patient lounge was amazing
8502,"Situation in A&E is terrible. Overcrowded, hot waiting rooms, the staff is stressed out which is understandable and I sympathise with them. However some behaviour was just gratuitously rude. When I enquired about how long would the wait be, the receptionist started loudly sighing and rolling her eyes at her colleagues to signal what an annoying patient I was. I just asked for a rough estimate as I have family I care for. Initially refusing to reply, then she conceded two people in front of me. I asked what it meant in terms of time. More theatrical sighing and eye rolls. Finally said half an hour. Wasn't it just easier to reply directly than all this drama? Completely out of line. The doctors are kind and dedicated once you see them, so that makes up for it."
318,A long wait and no resolution. Just a lot of assumptions made
2321,"The service, in these troubled times, was exemplary. The staff good humoured in the face of the current adversity."

730,"Orthotic shoes at Prince Royal University Hospital - I was sent by my surgeon to have a pair of blue trainers made with a heel raise and orthotics made for the shoes. I am a size 6. When the shoes finally arrived ( about 6-8 weeks later) they were a size 5, so they had to be returned to have another pair made with a heel raise. I finally received them another 6 weeks later. When I went to collect another shoe later in the year which I had had raised it was suggested I order another pair of trainers with the heel raise. It was agreed to do this pair in a grey. I waited 6-8 weeks and was contacted to pick the new shoes up. When I went to collect them I checked the size which this time was correct but they were blue not grey! How can they get these things so wrong. I have now got to wait another 6-8 weeks for a new pair of shoes to be done"
7227,Diagnostic Endoscopy - Thank You - I attended the endoscopy department for the first time yesterday and I'd just like to say a big thank you to everyone for the kind and very efficient way I was dealt with during my appointment. The care and attention I received throughout was very reassuring and appreciated.
200,quick and efficient service
3359,Very well cared for - We were admitted as my daughter had low oxygen sats. We were very well cared for and all the staff were lovely. Good parent facilities too and very clean and tidy. Thank you to everyone who looked after us.
9455,My mother was brought in to the a&e apartment today by ambulance. She has covid and was recommended to be brought in for a blood test and chest X-ray. The paramedics said she needs to stay hydrated and eat. She got to the hospital was put ‚Ä¶

5532,Everyone is so nice there
5990,"Urgent Treatment Centre - bureaucratic, disorganised NHS systems - You go there and they discharge you with a follow-up specialist appointment. You then try to see your GP for a sick note, and you find out that you needed to be given a discharge letter from the A&E. You call the Whittington 5 times: the line remains silent 2 times after being transferred, one time someone answers the phone and disconnects you immediately, one time somebody tells you I have people with broken bones here, call back and the final time someone tells you that the discharge letter (letters in 2020?) is only sent directly to your GP. Very frustrating experience trying to get help from the non-medical staff who simply doesn't care or doesn't know. Nobody knows when the letter will be sent and I was told that they cannot even access my file after I have been discharged by the UTC which is simply absurd."
4439,"On 28/12/2019 - The ambulance came within minutes and took me to the A&E. It was very busy. Me and my family would like to Thanks the amazing Paramedic, Doctors and Nursing staff were Wonderful, Kind, Caring and Professional. I can't Thank you enough! I would recommend the A&E to anyone. No one likes going to hospital but sometimes in emergency you have no choice. At Worthing hospital you will feel safe and well looked after. Well done to everyone & God Bless! "
395,"Think the 5 minute waited on phone call and type of answer to the follow up on the jab, unlike other nicer responses before, is the last straw."
3360,I was seen almost as soon as I arrived recieved treatment of a growth removal straight away. I was expecting a biopsy only so was delighted. Thank you so much

6871,Seating well spaced for waiting.Quick on time appointment.Hygiene measures in place and followed.
8319,"Went for my bloods done for the first time last week. I was sceptical and a little scared and i was panicing a bit as ive never done it before and the thought of sideway needles went through me. The door was wide open where atleast 4 people (workers) started to stand and talk and stare at me panicing while pulling their faces at me. I felt so embarassed over my reaction (which i couldnt help). And embarassed to be glared at by these people in such a mean way. For 1, why is the door open and these people just rudely look in? And 2 why be so unprofessional to make me feel so uncomfortable? Despite this, the women who did my bloods was absolutely lovely which made me feel a bit better."
8991,In and out quickly had op to be seen again in 2 weeks brilliant

3376,Attended an RTC yesterday on @ShardEndWMP whereby the driver ran off! Turns out one of the vehicles was stolen that day from @SolihullPolice and on false plates. Thankfully the other driver only had minor injuries. Thanks to @SheldonFire and @OFFICIALWMAS üëç
8987,The good old NHS which is under funded and appointments run late and results in increased car parking fees.
4311,"The nurse who I first spoke to and have me ibuprofen should not be in her current profession. She was rude, unprofessional and mocked me. I wasnt impatient and I followed the advice by 111. I will be raising a formal complaint about this member of your staff."
245,"Ear, Nose & Throat - Rushed, not thorough, zero communications - Rushed, superficial appointment with my daughter at the ENT department in late December. It was 4:40pm - evidently it was the Dr's last appt of the day and he was keen to finish up ASAP and get out of there. We were promised a further appt for an investigative test and a further separate but related referral for an allergy test, but nothing at all has been forthcoming - not even a write-up of the original appt. At the time I requested to check the address details they have on file for us to make sure they were correct, but was told by the very unhelpful nurse that wasn't possible as the clinic was being run by Kingston Hosp. On the plus side, apart from us, the hospital was absolutely empty - we didn't see a soul anywhere in the corridors during the few minutes we were there. "

4947,"Don't know - Very slow and very rude staff in A and E - After contacting 111, they asked for me to go to accident and emergency due to severe dehydratation following a ten day long food poisoning episode. I was very poorly and could hardly stand nor retain water, it was terrible. I was really concerned about myself and was taken to accident and emergency by my partner. Once there, the nurses were discussing their weekends on the front desk, discussing a prisoner from across the road in detail including his name, which horrified me as an ex dental nurse. patient confidentiality was breached. They were looking down at patients, laughing and joking. I actually thought it was a joke at first watching what I could see. The nurses were discussing their weekend and eating biscuits in front of a room of poorly patients really did set the tone. I sat for 1 hour before I was triaged, then waited 3 hours for a doctor, all whilst flopped on a chair. The doctor who saw me stated if i still felt poorly in 2 days, to return for an IV drip, even though i was severely unwell, i was dismissed, as it was a Saturday. Of course I knew that, the nurses detailing their planned night out supported that! She said as she saw me sip a tiny bit of water at the reception that I was obviously fine. I couldn't function. I felt undermined, like i was putting them out, even though 111 said I needed help from medical professionals. Never again will I set foot in such an unprofessional setting. To be in such a vital important setting and to act in such a manner has truly altered my perception of the NHS. One nurse even quoted this isn't anything and everything. What a bizaare culture this ward has, and for it to be the first point on entering the hospital. The new buildings do not compensate for ill mannered nurses. "
6890,A&E staff are fantastic! From surgeons doctors nurses and porters everyone was extremely considerate caring and very efficient. Nothing was too much trouble. I just wish other hospitals were as good. Thankyou to everyone involved with the care of my mother in law
234,Although a minor injury I was treated with courtesy and professionalism by Sam the nurse in attendance.
6944,Communication
6029,"Absolutely superb! Visiting London from Northumberland and experienced some mild chest pain. A call to 111 for advice resulted in an ambulance arriving within 4 minutes with 3 paramedics who certainly knew their stuff and I felt in safe hands. Mobile ECG and tests but to be 100 percent sure an ambulance ride to ED (A&E). Seen within minutes in ED by a Doctor who referred to his Registrar for confirmation. with another ECG, x-rays, ultrasound, blood tests back in an hour. All explained carefully and sensitively. Discharged after 3 hours with some meds and a letter for my GP in Northumberland. Outstanding Chelsea & Westminster Hospital! Amazing NHS! Truly humbling..."
8057,
349,The testing was comprehensive. Lots of questions to establish the root cause of the problem and explanations of the results established. I felt very re-assured
5751,"Minor injuries unit - Really good service!! - Brilliant, quick, safe, clean, tidy! Made my daughter relax and not worry or stress too much about what was going to happen x "
7442,I had a head injury felt awful but still waited 10 hrs in a& e
7545,Good service - Had a fall damaged wrist and fingers on other hand. Seen promptly and sent for X-ray. Returned and found nothing broken just swollen and bruised. All in eith return trip to X-ray two and a half hours compared with at least a six hour wait in A&E. could not fault staff. Those dealing with general customers were sympathetic and no one was treated poorly in my opinion even those who were trying the patience of staff. I was pleasantly surprised with the general kindness displayed. Well done all of you. 
8249,Just had my first dose of vaccine fantastic service from @GoodHopeUHB thank you.

6219,"Don't know - Attended for bloods - Delayed massively. Didn't have me on the list despite making appointment 6 days ago, mad eit very very clear to me as if I shouldnt be there. Ignored the fact I told her I was difficult to bleed and that I had one good vein... and attempted in my other arm anyway. Failed attempt. Proceeded to take blood from the vein I initially told her about. Thanks for a) making me feel like I shouldnt have been there B) not listening to me. As a medical professional myself I always listen to my patients with preference to bloods. Poor service, poor interaction. Do not recommend. "
6686,"Helpful friendly staff. Maps or signposts needed to find your way around, as well as helpful staff."
2925,"Smooth transition, very friendly staff. All fully explained. Good care after the endoscopy."

1034,"I cannot thank Becky Clifford and her truly amazing team on the Observation Ward! Compassionate, kind and caring. This team deserves recognition for their support when someone is at an all time low. What true angels they are! Thank you, Toni Jones X"
9794,"Very good staff, i was seen to very quick I couldnt fault them"
3340,"1 -it was amazing!!  It was quick, the nurse was exceptionally educated on how to treat the problem and applied in my opinion the best practice for the problem. Highly highly recommend. I felt valued and it equated of the standard I would expect in the private sector."
407,"Stroke - wonderful and prompt attention for elderly relative - We would like to thank all the staff from the stroke staff at A&E to the staff on the stroke ward at William Harvey. They were very attentive and the ward was well equipped, the food was tempting. One negative though....the wonderful staff were severely let down by the zero empathy shown by one of the senior staff nurses.(name can be provided if needed) On admittance to the ward, this nurse who was apparently in charge of my mother did not visit me and my mum once to say hello and to check on her. I was there for over two hours and nothing. Each day I visited for a week and never once did she give me a progress report. Sad and disappointing for her colleagues. She also avoided answering any questions in a civil manner. Three other members of my family witnessed this behaviour. It spoiled an otherwise exceptional experience of the NHS. More detail can be provided if necessary."
2577,"Accident and emergency services - Excellent practice - Kind and caring staff, efficient service despite being a busy unit. Very thankful to all the hard working staff. "
2215,"Caring and explained well. Cannula put in well for often faints, so very good."
9623,
5556,Accident and emergency services - Very caring - Despite Covid restrictions the ambulance crew and the staff in A&E could not have been more helpful. My wife had had a fall and cut her scalp to the bone. Wound all stitched up neatly. They even washed all the blood out of her hair. Very pleased.
7937,"Brilliant practice - The staff was very pleasant, the counsellors were brilliant not once did I feel I was being judged, blamed or made to feel guilty, the techniques they gave me and show me were really helpful. I still have good days and bad days but the techniques help and I am so grateful for their time and their energy in helping people like myself. "

9318,"Breast cancer services - Wonderful Service - After attending the Breast Clinic on 26th August I would like to say thankyou to everyone involved throughout the whole process from having a mammogram, ultrasound and examination and advice from a senior nurse they all really put you at ease and have great empathy knowing how nervous you are. It is great that all the results are given to you on the day and for me everything was absolutely 100 percent okay. So once again many thanks ."

9931,"I have nothing but words and thoughts of praise for all the staff that dealt with my son's case last night and today! The A & E department were amazing and very efficient and quick to deliver a diagnosis and provide the solution. The staff from the Women and Children's Unit were absolutely amazing! I'm so sorry that i don't remember everybody's names but the whole team of doctors, surgeons and anesthesiologists, nurses, technicians were very professional and caring. Even though i was panicking on the inside, they made my son (and me) feel very comfortable and you couldn't tell that he was going to have a surgery. He was actually left with a good memory of the whole situation, not a traumatic experience. The nurse that was assigned to him while we stayed in the Rain Forest ward, Rachael, is one of the most amazing and kind human beings that i've met! "

8297,"High quality care from outstanding, qualified and careing staff."
9168,"Firstly, I must confess to working for the QVH Trust. However, today I was an inpatient at our QVH theatres. I will admit, as I'm sure many people are, to being apprehensive before my procedure, small though it may have been, but, nevertheless, I was the patient who knew nothing really what was going to happen. Of course, the theatre team went through what the procedure would involve but . . . Now, after my 40 minute or so time in theatre I have nothing but absolute praise for the teams - both in theatre and the recovery lounge. We are very lucky, no, privileged to have staff as we do working at OUR hospital. Thank you very much."
7553,"I have been attending the fracture clinic for the past 6 months and all the staff have been fantastic. They have been so kind, caring and supportive. Thanks to all of you, you are amazing! "

8289,"Hi there all. How does someone say thanks to all the staff that dealt with myself recently with the pressures of Covid? My name is John and I came in on 14th January last for a complete knee replacement. One might say an everyday op with today's technology but that said and without going into great detail a couple of other not foreseen things hit me and certainly knocked me down a bit! . So what should have been a three / four day stay turned out to be nine days. A very big thanks to Mr Hawkin and one of the doctors namely Douglas, sorry I've name dropped but the same thanks is extended to ALL the staff who were so caring. God Bless you all and stay safe. John"
3717,Minor eye surgery last week. Would like to thank all staff for their expertise and welcoming manner in this awful current climate. I was in and out within an hour and I'm healing well. Thank you all! 
8902,"Very efficient, helpful staff."
6012,"My wife - Last month, within 20 minutes of the phone call, the excellent ambulance staff arrived. I did not see my wife again (due to Covid rules) for 11 days during which time her quadruple by-pass heart surgery was the centre of the care she received from so many people - subsequently including our GP and Pharmacist. I hope these people gain the happiness they deserve from the good they do."
3363,Reception staff took the time and pointed me in the right direction for Castle Outpatients (although it was really busy!). My appointment was on time. Dr. was nice.
3591,"Really good information prior to the procedure. Very friendly staff, very modern and clean environment. Nurses and doctor very kind and efficient. A very nice cup of tea, sandwich and biscuit afterwards, not expected but gratefully received, well done Royal Surrey"
2783,"The lady at reception my the main entrance gave clear directions as to where to go, when I arrived it was easy and clear to check in. It was busy and two patents were high needs and it was very stressful for us and staff but the staff remained calm and professional. I was called through by a warm welcome and was seen on time. I was seen very quickly by the surgeon."

17,Staff always friendly and helpful.
7924,"Accident and emergency services - Poor service - My elderly mother was left on a trolley for 12 hours even when in a ward where there were at least 3 empty beds. She had had seizure, cpr etc and she was clearly delirious and continuously repetitive in speech and behaviour, unable to walk etc. She was then sent home at 11:30pm that night having had no assessment and an assumption that she would have relatives at home to look after her. Was told to get medicine from GP although they were closed for several days. After insisting, finally got some medication. Paramedics as usual were great. However the trolley bed moving was ridiculous and she spent some time being moved up and down corridors. Doctors spent loads of unnecessary time wandering around trying to find where their patient had been moved to now. Badly organised. "
1481,"What is the point of having a complaints process when they don't even bother to admit faults and mistakes? Stop backing yourself up and lying about everything. You are an absolute disgrace of a hospital and I wish this were not my closest one. I would not trust this hospital with my life. Sort out your staff namely Dr Ameen the dermatologist. She treats her patients terribly and doesn't have time for you. Why work at a hospital if patient care is not your top priority, Dr Ameen? "

Left me feeling I had been a nuisance I have had MRI at Manchester, Blackburn and Beardwood all those had been great staff but Chorley on Sunday was worse experience and would not use that service again even if it meant waiting a lot longer to have an MRI elsewhere. How sad as it looked a lovely hospital and reception staff lovely. "

4354,Attended with elderly family member by Ambulance. Triaged. Then a nearly 5 hour wait to be seen by a doctor. I appreciate that they were busy but I did observe a doctor sat in front of a computer screen for over 1 1/2 hrs. Apart from that she was well cared for by the minions NO disrespect intended

1466,The whole experience from start to finish was exceptional and the cleanliness of the wing was outstanding.

4838,No need to do anything better - you do an amazing job. Made me feel really at ease and well looked after. Thank you.
529,"So ... wards are closed to relatives visiting and hospital staff not picking up phones. It's very difficult to get updates from the hospital. Tonight I managed to speak to my 94 year old Mum on her mobile who was very upset. Recovering from emergency hip replacement surgery she is dependent upon staff helping her in and out of bed to go to the loo. Tonight she called her call button and was waiting 40 minutes for help. Consequently she didn't need the loo after 40 minutes but help to be cleaned up!! Nurse was stroppy with her as if it was her fault. Afterwards said to her God bless, good night and don't call again. How on earth can someone in a caring profession talk to a poor defenseless woman like that. My Mum said she can't wait to come home."
4575,i was in surgical short stay then moved to freshmen for only a few hours before discharge the experience was good
6214,Staff are very helpful and caring | Nothing
5105,"The male nurse Salim / Saleem (not sure of the exact spelling of his name) in the Accident and Emergency Injury department was extremely rude, arrogant and disrespectful to the last T. He left no stone unturned in trying to humiliate me as a patient and completely bullied me the entire way. This guy needs to be out of his job. Nobody deserved to be yelled at and lectured during their visit especially whilst they are in agonisingly pain!!! Please learn some respect. Also A and E receptionists are extremely ignorant and I waited 8 hours just to be seen. Would not ever recommend the appalling service to anyone. If JR don't address these issues quickly, then that's a fault on them. I agree that the NHS does not have sufficient funding, however sufficient funding isn't required to teach staff to have and maintain a basic level of respect and human decency! Salim you can have you meniscus and shove ut up yourself. And by the way, please deflate your big head. Thanks a lot for bullying me..."

I got a rude registrar who hung up on me even though I explained I have autism and other severe problems on top of my chronic physical pain. The person also refused to give a name and refused to explain what a registar is. THe person then also claimed to be a consultant neurosurgeon. I am not sure that you can be a registrar and a consultant but I could be wrong. I have since had to go through a complaints process which is causing me more stress, especially since I had to go through a complaints process to get any treatment at all from NHS. The modern system of telephone appointments means they can just now hang up on you when they feel like it. I was not rude, did not swear, there was no reason for me to be treated like that. It has left me in a terrible state since I had been waiting a long time for that appointment and have to deal with severe pain. When you try to call back you cannot get through so you are left with an online complaints process which they are allowed to leave for forty days before dealing with. I did write a letter to my actual consultant several months ago, put in the post, got no reply, so wanted to ask for some replies to my questions. I have been under this hospital now for two and a half years and have only since my consultant once for ten minutes. It is worrying that the service is so bad because London hospitals tend to be better than elsewhere so. The area I live in we have even worse hospital services than that. "

6931,"Disgusted - I have been a victim of sexual & emotional & physic abuse for almost 30yrs. My mental health has suffered. I have flashbacks, nightmares, I cannot sleep, I live in fear I do not go out, etc I was told I suffer from depression and ptsd. I have been under chapel st for awhile now and had a home visit last year by a lead practitioner who was very kind and caring, I was then seen by another dr who made comments in a letter that were untrue and I made a complaint Which was my right and I received a letter of apology and the letter was amended, that dr has now left. I was seen by a cpn recently and I have now had a letter telling me they can no longer see me. Yes I made complaints & showed my unhappiness with the service with good reason but that is not an excuse to throw somebody off the books esp somebody who's mental health is suffering 24/7 due to being a victim of severe ongoing abuse for years. Appalling. I hope nobody else ever suffers under the care of chapel st. "
7646,"Blood Tests via drive thru welcomed - When I had my blood test at the main hospital it was very stressful, being disabled my wife had to bring me and push the wheelchair, trying to open the doors and holding them open was difficult to say the least, that was after finding a disabled parking bay, need the space to open the door wide enough for me to get out. Then came along COVID-19 and you can get a blood test at the keepmote stadium, you don't need to get out of the car, so no need to wait for the wife, I can drive myself. Hope this can continue in the future and make having a blood test without the stress."

7690,"Desperately trying to get through regarding a referral, been advised the number I'm calling. I've called repeatedly over a few hours now with zero help. I say help because they staff have technically answered the phone, only to mute the mic and then hang up, or immediately hang up after answering between every few calls. If they were too busy for the calls then they wouldn't go through but the fact they're answering just to hang up is awful/ The reception staff clearly do not have the ability to assist with calls if you have appointments or prescriptions. Sending off complaint and hoping I'll eventually get through."

861,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease - Hospital services are brilliant - smoking outside is not. - The services in the hospital are outstanding. However, you cannot enter, or leave, the hospital without getting a lungful of cigarette smoke from the people smoking in front of the signs declaring the site to be non-smoking. This is really bad news if you have asthma - as the CPOD department will know. Would it be possible for King's Mill hospital to enforce its non-smoking policy on the site? It would help the health of everybody, including the smokers."
4094,"Don't know - Paramedics-thank you - You are fantastic. Came to see me as I was unwell and were helpful and reassuring, So grateful to you for your kindness and swift way you took me to A&E where I was admitted. You are simply wonderful and deserve high praise, Thank you so much for all you do."
5574,"Hi. My name is Prisca Zanzala, this morning around 8.30am I called for an ambulance because my little brother was having a fit. The ambulance came quite quickly, thank you for that and a man came in the house to run a few test and check on my brother.. First of all I understand that the job that you guys do is very important and can be stressful, infact my husband is a primary care practitioner and he works with children and does four days shifts. So I recognise the job can be ...hard and I am grateful. However I had a very disappointing experience when the man that came in, started asking me questions because I requested to go with my brother to the hospital since English is not his first language. He then began asking me where I was from which I answered that I was from Mauritius. He asked why did we move to the UK and not to France instead since we speak French. He even asked me was it because there is no job in Mauritius would be why I moved here. I then did not respond because this is a very rude statement. He then went on asking us what type of papers we had to stay in the UK and that I should make sure that my brother has his papers on him. He further asked how long we were in the country which I answered 8 years for me and 3 years since my brother is here. He then commented that it has been 3 years for my brother then why is he still struggling to speak English, again I did not respond but just so you know my brother has learning difficulties that is why struggles. I don't understand why are these information are important when we were just in shock of what just happened to my brother, it was very inappropriate and definitely rude.. My understanding is that you guys need to make sure that my brother is fine and I was not aware that you guys work for the home office as well. All I am asking is that you educate your staff because this comes across as rude and racist. If you want a copy of all of our immigration status, I can send it over but frankly this is absolutely rude.. I do not think that anyone should be treated like that specially in face of such stress that I was going through with my brother being ill. We are honest people that work honest jobs. And the reason why Mauritius is bilingual its because Mauritius was a British colony with slaves working in fields for Britain. You should really look into educating your staff. Thank you. Mrs P Zanzala"
93,Massive kudos to the @mitie security person in the @OUHospitals ED tonight treating a very very troubled person with compassion not aggression even in the face of considerable adversity #respect
1173,Parked easily. Waited for a short time and seen quickly. Procedure was done professionally and with care.
2813,Don't know - Terrible hospital. - I wouldn't recommend anyone go to this hospital at all. I went to A&E on Monday night after having a fall the triage nurses were absolutely lovely and really understanding but that's where it started and ended. I was eventually seen by a doctor who took me for an X-ray after my X-ray I was just dumped outside the doors of CDU and left there until the doctor came back to see me. I was then taken somewhere else where the same doctor put me in a room and told me that I could sit in either the bed or the chair bearing in mind I had just been told that I had a broken ankle and foot the doctor walked away and left me sat in the wheelchair with no breaks on it and I had to struggle to get myself out of the chair and on to the bed at one point the chair moved whilst I was trying to stand up. I then had 2 lovely nurses come in to see me but the nurse who took a blood sample from left the needle that she had used in the bed with me. I was then moved to another room and just left with no clue what was going on. The next day I was past from one place to another at one point I was put on a ward where my bag had been left wide open on a bed with my phone and everything on show it had been taken from where I was staying and just left on a bed. I had an incredibly rude consultant who decided to reposition my fractured ankle without any painkillers and then had the nerve to turn round and say to me you don't want surgery do you when I'm screaming in pain because he was squeezing and twisting my ankle he made me feel like an inconvenience-no bedside manner what so ever. I was then put on CDU where I had a nurse shout at me from across the room to find out what my name was and how you spell it I had to ask twice for painkillers and never got any. Physio came and watched me walk with crutches for 2 seconds and then just left when I was trying to get back to the bed I could've fallen but that didn't matter to them. I was then just thrown out of the hospital no one knew if I had someone picking me up I was just wheeled outside of A&E and left sat there in a wheelchair in the cold on my own at no point did any ask if there was someone coming for me I was just thrown outside like I didn't matter. I wouldn't let my worst enemy go to this hospital. You are not a patient you are just an inconvenience that they want to be rid of as soon as possible. 
9507,"Unable to give 0 stars. Dad sat there with dementia and Alzheimers for a week before we were told someone could visit. Discharged him to an appalling care home, Meavy view. Became so poorly he was admitted to Rochdale infirmary who again discharge too soon and he eventually passed away. The NHS are not a shining example of ourstanding care in our house at present. Stick with your wages for now. They definitely do not need reviewing. A life is a life not just about money. If it's about that you're in the wrong job!!!! "
9818,"Very unprofessional - I went for my glaucoma test today. First of all, I had to wait 2 hours for my appointment, it was originally 10am and after making numerous enquires from nurses, my turn came at 12pm. I saw a doctor who doesn't know how to use computer. He asked me did you bring eye drops which you use? I told him to look at my records on the computer, which he couldn't find it. He told me that I had a whole in my left eye which I wasn't told before and it was quite shocking and when I asked him you must be new here, he told me that he has been here for all his life. I thought I came to any third world country's hospital."
811,Children's & Adolescent Services - Waiting time is too long - We went to the hospital to have my 3 year old son check with a high fever. Waiting time is extremely absurd! We arrive 9pm and it's 2am now we are still yet to be check by the doctor. It seems they're waiting for people to just go home. The Hospital is completely understaffed. Very very disappointed.

It's an amazing ward i'll never forget what they have done for my uncle, he is still there now but due to leave soon.

5738,My Dad - I am crying while I type this. I will not go into the details of our story but will say that that the whole team (especially the HCA's who needed to be with my Dad constantly) have been incredible. I have been an RMN for 30 years and I am so proud of what this ward team have done for my Dad. My Dad has been a hard working and wonderful husband and father and how he has become is the cruellest illness possible-however knowing he has been cared for by the George Earl Team gives us some comfort.
2189,"I hereby right this review, A month ago, The palliative care nurse of the NHS Princess Of Whales Hospital (Bromsgrove UK) sedated my grandfather for long periods of time without supplying him any form of nutrition eventually causing his death and succumbing to dehydration. My grandfather has been cremated recently and we are soon to intern him. I look at his casket and think if it weren't for these people, he would be living. I write this bad review to expose them, I am planning on pressing charges."

Never been here before for any emergency but this hospital should be placed on a pillar and to me is a pinnacle of excellence and it angers me when people easily slag these heroes off!! We were treated we respect, courtesy and excellent care and these staff went above and beyond. Thank you everyone! "

Even though I am very lonely the group leaders put me at ease and were very understanding, I can sometimes (not all the time) divert my focus away from my depression and pain. When it works it does feel a bit better although that is not for very long, maybe a couple of hours or so but even that is an improvement. I know that because of my disability it won't get much better but sometimes that couple of hours makes me feel a bit better [Happy with 'Staff skills'] [Very happy with 'Staff attitude'] [Happy with 'Team work'] "

Once I was available at the arranged time, 3:30pm, I called the practice and was transferred 6 times to different departments, all team members were rude and had no care about this issue. It took 20 minutes until the last call, said she would send an email then immediately hung up. Absolutely disgusted with the level of service and attitude, this is my first appointment and I am very disappointed and unimpressed to say the least! "

5726,"I wish I could give 0 stars. By far the worst hospital I've ever been. Save your time and go to Enfield or even Royal free. Unhelpful, lazy and incompetent staff with no sense of direction. Went to A&E and the queue was ridiculous but the staff were just abysmal and couldn't care less."
4427,"Fantastic service - I struggled initially to get an appointment slot, and found the online service quite counterintuitive to use, but the actual service at the centre was great. I had a contraceptive coil removed and a new one inserted. I was quite apprehensive about the procedure, as last time I had the same thing done (at a different GP practice), it was extremely painful. The staff at the Hathersage Centre made me feel very comfortable, and did a great job - it was still uncomfortable, but not anywhere near as bad as I was anticipating. "
1942,"The appointment was on time and the technician was efficient and friendly. Also seemed happy to answer queries about the equipment, methodology and purpose. As for improvements, good afternoon, could I have your name please? would be nice to hear from reception rather than the blank look which prompted me to make the greeting and do the introduction. If there was a smile or a facial expression, it obviously doesnt show when wearing a mask."
6935,A&E staff where very kind and compassionate towards my situation which led to my care. Having worked in the system at SDH the staff morale appeared to be very high which reflects on patient experience. I could not fault them one bit....! 10/10 5***** 01/12/19
6283,Thanks to all on Wards D8 and D6 and the at @StockportNHS for all the care and humour over the past few days. You're all amazing! Feeling much better now and hopefully home today. https://t.co/HxqGNqsbvz
3332,"Staff are great but 15 hours since called 999, 9 hours for ambulance and 6 hours on a trolley and still not seen a doctor."
5668,"Dermatology - Fantastic care, 11/10 - I was slotted in at short notice, and despite being totally out of sorts I was made to feel totally comfortable, and understood the upcoming biopsy procedure within a few minutes of being introduced to the doctor. The procedure itself was quick and painless, with the most noteworthy thing being the Doctor going the extra mile to ensure I was comfortable during the procedure, and doing their best to quell my nerves about an upcoming surgery. I honestly can't rate the staff I've interacted with or the service of the NHS higher. "
1606,Care was brilliant throughout pregnancy and birth. Birth was smooth and I felt safe and supported which made the experience even more magical. After care was also very good in both shere ward and community. Made the first couple of days and weeks easier with the support and care provided

7070,It seems to be never ending waiting. I have ankle injury and kept having to move back and forth to cubicle. Then advised i could be released and no one did so sat for an hour waiting until someone noticed me sitting alone. I missed a lift as well due to this. My blood was taken and the valve left in my arm which i took out when i got home. In all i spent 3 hours in haslemere and then 5 hours in guildford.

9064,Staff Attitude
9918,"Vocational rehabilitation support - I know how pressured the NHS is at present and facing with a long queue of patients to be seen and provide the with the best treatment as ever. Even though, all of you are trying to make sure that such treatment and care is provided accordingly. Having said that I want to say thank you for all your effort and determination to assist me with my needs and be there to listen and putting my mind at ease when anxious about my present condition. By going back to 30 odd years, the past wights the present as I remember how quickly was the NHS with their appointments and above all with treatment. You all are under severe pressure at present due to COVID and some other unprecedented situations but even though continue to make sure everybody is treated fairly, compassionate and with empathy. This makes me see the integrity you all maintain regardless the situation and scenario we are in. I do not have have words to express the gratitude I have towards such dedication and once again I must say, Thank You to all of you."

3391,Good staff polite and efficient
6037,Fantastic Practice - I had my catheter changed today and wanted to thank the nurse who was so patient with me. She was very understanding of my issue of having a huge prostate which made changing difficult for her. With expert care and kindness it finally got into place. Not forgetting the helpful pleasant receptionists at this excellent practice plus the nurse / sister? who booked me in and met me today as I arrived. We're very lucky to have such wonderful nursing staff in our district. Many many thanks

2462,Don't know - No phone answering by the ward in 12 hours - Despite some wonderful individuals the hospital needs an admin shake up. Why can't something be put in place by email to update anxious relatives a nbd and take messages a if the ward won't answer the phone all day? We have a very confused elderly relative In the Acute Assessment ward who thinks she has been forgotten.

This is the fourth or fifth time we have been there and each time the care has been exemplary. Thank you xx"

5756,"Completely misdiagnosed my mother in law for the type of cancer that the Marsden were over 90 percent sure she had. It took from April 2019 to end of June 2019 for them to actually determine that she has a very common cancer. Within this time frame they had also confirmed she would not have very long to live, very bluntly too by guessing from scanning what this type of cancer was that they thought she had. Only by chance they said they would do another biopsy to be sure it was this and turned out it is a common cancer. As she has type of cancer that is treatable (if caught early), they basically discharged her from their care and transferred to our local hospital. During this time it was a lot of work getting all information across to our local hospital. Both our local and Kings College Hospital are rather confused as to how the Marsden got this so wrong or even thought she had this rare type of Sarcoma. I definitely think that if they noticed the exact cancer it was from the beginning, this cancer would have been treated and she would be in remission now. Being as this is one of the UK's leading cancer specialist hospitals, I cannot comprehend how they managed to unidentify a common cancer. Appalling hospital service and no support either throughout our time at this hospital."
6099,The two doctors I saw were brilliant and so kind. It was very efficient too and easy to arrange follow up appointment

3853,Excellent treatment
5900,"Absolutely awful place. I was told for a number of weeks leading up to my sons birth that I would be allowed in to see him once he was born. The day comes when he is actually born and the incompetent staff there then said that they had gotten the information wrong as I wouldn't be allowed to see my own son until he returned home. To top this off the midwife was very patronising and never once apologised for wrongfully informing me about being allowed in to visit my son. Had I... been told weeks ago that I wouldn't be allowed in then I wouldn't have been so disappointed. She couldn't even bring herself to apologise, instead just said ‚Äúyes it's my mistake‚Äù. Not good enough. I think you fail to realise the importance of a child's birth to a father. I met my son the day after he was born. Maybe they don't realise that I will never get that moment I should have had with him on his birthday back. Still also struggling to understand how a hospital doesn't know it's own COVID restrictions until the moment I am making my way to the hospital. Absolutely disgusting. See More"
9101,"Wasting of time - It's 3 months I'm waiting to see a dermstologist in the Westminster and Hospital center having a skin problem which it has risk of becoming c√°ncer of penis, I had it for the Wednesday and they call me Tuesday saying that they cancel the appointment, that they will let me know in two weeks or more when the appointment will be. In the meantime I still have pain and the skin irritated. I wouldn't recommend the nhs in this country at all."

7958,"The nurses, careers and drs where very caring and catered for my every need. The only problem I had was that I had to wait 4 hrs for some gaviscon as the dr had to sign off on it. I was in a lot of pain I hadnt eaten all day and had missed the evening meal. I was bought a sandwich but all I really needed that gaviscon. I also asked for anti sickness tablets as I was suffering with nausea but I again I had to wait for the dr to sign off on it and I never received them."

The staff were wonderful, particularly in the way they handled his confusion and agitation. I was kept fully informed. The consultant was informative and understanding and a model of how surgeons should behave towards relatives and patients with dementia. They could not have cared for my father any better. He did not want to leave and I quite understand why. Thank you"

I went to Pharmacy, early afternoon, bad signage, first queue for about 25 minutes outside in cold, for someone to take my phone number, check name etc, then send me back out again, that I should wait for sms / text when ready, told at least 15 mins. Unfriendly security by the door, had changed between my waiting periods."

8185,You have better protection against COVID19 and better Discharge letter. Food I felt was dry and could not ask to leave anything left off if not like but with all hospitals it would be nice and choose and pay for food you like.
9410,One of the most unprofessional hospital in LONDON. Staffs are making jokes and laughing while we were holding our sick baby to be treated. Nurses have inadequate knowledge on handling basic equipment. If you can avoid it and get treated somewhere better.
5801,Good..

They kept him cheerful through a very difficult time. My only critism is that the different departments don't seem to liaise, causing unnecessary delays and problems? "
7404,The treatment was good but there was a 45 minute wait before it took place. Everyone seemed to have a 3 pm appointment?

I went there after my cat had bitten me badly, was assessed straight away by a lovely nurse and treated by a very kind nurse practitioner, who cleaned it up very gently, out a dressing on and gave me the necessary antibiotics. And all this at the height of the Covid 19 pandemic. I cannot praise them highly enough."
4440,"Lack of coronavirus precautions - I had to attend the lower ground floor x-ray department. Waiting was in a small, unventilated area with spacing under 2m which became quite crowded. Whilst some people obviously require the support of someone with them there was no notices to discourage unnecessary accompaniment causing the waiting area to be even more full. At least 5 people were either not wearing masks or wearing them under their noses. No staff either checked or enforced correct mask wearing. I felt very uncomfortable and went to wait in the corridor in the end, standing waiting despite the pain in my leg. I would feel very reluctant to attend again given these conditions."
582,3rd visit and can't fault them. Much better than others he has been in. Feels the hospital and staff are under funded but that's not their fault and they manage so well.

3619,"Poor care and diagnosis! - Husband complained of severe earache, I took him to the unit on a Saturday morning, when seen I explained that husband had likely ear infection for third time in less than 6 months. Nurse looked in his ears, took temperature, felt his neck and stated viral infection, go to chemist and get ear drops, and take analgesics. I am a nurse / midwife of 42years standing, know my husband and his health very well. Tried to explain that I felt it wasn't viral, but fobbed off! Two days later at GP surgery, strong antibiotics, plus ear drops and urgent referral to ENT specialist . Four days following GP visit, telephone contact from GP to inform us that infection extremely serious, risk of meningitis or encephalitis and so antibiotics changed to stronger ones, and to present at GP surgery in 4-5 days to be re assessed! If become ill, told to present husband at A & E! So much for good care. They didn't listen to the patient!! "

8920,"Don't know - Urology Department - I was diagnosed, unexpectedly, with cancer during routine surgery. The treatment and care that I have received from all members of the Urology team has been exceptional. From the head of the department, to the nursing staff, to the administrative staff, who collectively form an excellent team. My treatment has been without fault. I would certainly not hesitate to recommend this team to any person who, unfortunately, may require their services. "
3281,"Utter disgrace of a hospital, my father who has multiple conditions in his 60s had a fall and had a head injury swollen possible broken nose. He does not speak great English and was a little confused / dizzy from the head injury despite this the uncompassionate security did not allow my mother in to assist him, instead he told her she was not allowed in only the patient then proceeded to not assist my father who was lost as to where to go. Further more, they had seen to him and basically tried to get him out the door as soon as they could without even doing any scans of his head even though he stressed his vulnerability and concerns. To top this off instead of letting him out the entrance at 2am where there is little to no people around they made him walk around the hospital to the other side exit . Now I understand during covid the system of one way traffic works but when it's at a time where there are no other people present instead of making him walk all the way around they could show some empathy and let him slip out of the entrance that he was already at. Worst hospital with the worst level of care, I'd much rather go to another hospital or just stay at home. Very disappointed with the care given here where you would most expect it to be"

I've a genetic condition which prevents easy bloody taking and covers my veins in lipoedema and lymphedema, some members of staff have gone above and beyond to do their job, whilst others have been rude and insinuated I perhaps have caused this problem myself! Rude and factually incorrect, further training obviously needed for at least two members of staff! The phonix centre as a whole is underfunded and understaffed but they all do the very best they can with the budget they have ."

5265,"Don't know - Poor and not enough carparking - We could not find any carparking spaces within the Wythenshawe boundary, we tried for 40 minutes and was force to use the private carpark next to the staff carpark at the rear. This carpark has a payment system of using your mobile phone to pay over the internet. Our signal was poor we could not even speak to the parking firm due to the poor signal. We were in the carpark for over the 10 minute charge time trying to contact the payment system or the office. When we left we were charged with an offence. Tried to appeal, what a waste of time that was."

The consultants in a and e are rude and I guarantee you they will 100 percent refuse to give your child antibiotics and say it's viral no matter how ill they are! Also it's only open 8am till midnight there is a reason for that! They have no Intensive care unit or surgeons on site if your child needed something urgent ‚Ä¶think long and hard about coming here with your child it's empty for a reason .

For 5 times already I have been waiting 1, 2 hours after my appoiment time has been scheduled and they always don't know what happen. There are many pregnant ladies which feeling unwell or has another appointment, or has to go somewhere and because always there are delay like more then 10, 15 minutes, the plans are going to run over . Really disappointed."

We understand all the Covid regulations and although we couldn't visit, we were regularly clearly updated. We were able to FaceTime with her when she was moved to end of life care. A family member was able to be with her when she passed away. The care she was given over this short period was exception, we are all extremely grateful for the support she had at this very sad time. We would like to thank all the teams who cared for mum during this sad time."

Like staying in a hotel with own bed space and great care and putting you at ease, post-op. tea and toast quickly on hand. My enthusiasm for this department is such that I cannot wait for a request for review to arrive! Last year I had Greenlight Laser to prostate and my Surgeon knows he is my superhero now for exceptionally (?) ringing me, a then 78 year old, on a Saturday afternoon to ask if I wanted to go on his list - eternally grateful. Delighted to be able to see him again and again early New Year (?). I told the nurses at the time they were undercover angels and repeated this again on this occasion. Repeated superlatives will add nothing to my praise and gratitude, suffice it to say in percentage terms I received a million percent attention - NHS you are represented here in a quite extraordinary way.

I found it welcoming and clean- I was given a mask to protect me and others during the Corona virus. I was triaged pretty straight away and then saw the same nurse/ Doctor for further tests- bloods etc. Although I had to wait in between the tests it wasnt that bad. The staff were patient- Im a little hard of hearing! They talked me through my health condition and symptoms and gave me advice for when I got home. They were excellent, patient, professional and knowledgeable. If I need A and E again, Whiston is the place I would definitely go. A big thank you to all of the staff, you're brilliant! "

9708,I attended The eye clinic yesterday. The biggest complaint from me is the letter sent to me with the appt. Said pupil dilating eye drops would be used. No driving afterwards .dark glasses to be worn. No eye drops were required apparently and have not been required for sometime for the in depth retinal photo I can done. SO WHY ON EARTH SAY THAT THEY WOULD!!! ???!!! ??? I could have driven myself instead of involving my husband. Many other people would have had to inconvenience a friend or relative. The staff that carried out the procedure were NOT the problem here . They were very good .

I probably had personal contact with 50+ members of staff during my stay and every single one was lovely, often in the face of some incredible rudeness from certain patients. Whilst the sudden illness that brought me in was no pleasure at all, I have been looked after, waited on and treated like a person who's valued by the NHS staff. You folks deserve so much more from this country. Thank you."

1113,Everyone was very kind caring and understanding
4298,Treated me well
3344,Fantastic hospital and staff but the car park is so small and the parking space's. It's almost impossible to get out of the car without hitting the next car. I am a size 10/12 and can only just get out of the car and so I really think more needs to be done to accommodate peoples needs. Many people will not have the ability to get out of the car but yet they are not registered disabled and so this really does put the hospital in a bad position when it comes to accessibility to all.
6373,Friendly staff | no
8838,A miss communication happened during my stay in hospital which affected me for a short time but once I was handed over to the right team my experience was very good

I'm very disappointed. Now I have to book a normal consultation because he didn't solved the problem."
4391,My daughter was post natal after a c section was poorly and was taken to hospital by ambulance to A&E . Due to bed shortage was left to sit alone in the public A&E in her PJs holding her water sample. Disgraceful. Is this really how we treat people.
6355,"Accident and emergency services - Really dirty but friendly - I recently visited a&e and you could see the staff trying their best but they put me in a room that I wouldn't put a dog in, it was disgustingly dirty I ended up sitting outside as the guards were constantly on their phones and the noise was a trigger I was in a terrible mental state it was so embarrassing people seeing me fall apart. I ended up walking out because no one would give me a straight answer on what was happening so I got impatient luckily I sorted myself out hate leaving a terrible review but hygiene is lacking but patients who create a mess should be held liable too. Get those rooms cleaned I'll happily do it for you üòÅ"
9307,"visit to a&e - My wife was taken to A & E at Addenbrookes Hospital yesterday. I travelled with her but they would not let me in with her. She was taken because they thought she was having a mini stroke. She was given scan and x-rays and left with no knowledge of findings. They decided to send her home at 8. 30 pm, called to say could I collect her. They would not let me in the building then a nurse brought her out in a wheelchair. On arriving home I found she still had a cannula in her arm as no one checked, also still had all the ecg stickers on her body. No discharge notes either. I find this disgraceful behaviour."

140,When i got their i did the self check in and sat down. Unfortunately the self check in didnt tell the Dr. i was their until she called my mobile.
3077,"Don't know - Basic patient care lacking - Taken by ambulance from Chase Farm (who were wonderful) following seizure. ED very good. Then moved to MSSU where it all changed. Apparently I was high risk of falls but no one explained this. In fact no one communicated anything - even how to order food. I have autism and hyper sense to smells, textures and can only eat certain food. Tried to explain this but wasn't noted and no one had time to listen who could understand. Wasn't helped by it being 33 degrees outside. But the HCA and Nurse didn't want me to get out of bed even to the toilet. When I asked for help twice I was told to wait which meant I wet the bed (so embarrassing). No one explained results of previous MRI until I left. No one told me how long I would be in. At one point I fell and the HCA grabbed me by my underwear to pull back upright. I work as an HCA and we are trained to slow the fall then sort it out. Same HCA also grabbed me by wrists to stop me going to toilet as she wanted me to use commode so wet myself again - surely better to support to toilet to maintain dignity? Offered one cup of tea a day only and water jug changed once a day despite the temperature. When I explained I couldn't eat anything on the menu (it took a day to find out where the menu was) they couldn't take me to buy something at costa. A friend tried explain yet nothing happened so was left with what he could bring in as they said otherwise as they couldn't let me go down assisted to costa it was a glucose drip or nothing. Severe headache and stomach ache kept getting paracetamol that made me sick so no improvement until a lovely doctor came at 3am to look and gave Intravenous painkiller so could sleep. She said needed further investigation of stomach but nothing on discharge notes so guess nothing else happening there? Staff need training on Aspergers / hyper sense and issues really as they aren't obvious but have basic effect on patient comfort. No form of entertainment in MSSU at all and spent whole time being told to get back into bed and stop being naughty. Made to feel like a child and a nuisance. Lack of communication was biggest issue with discharge notes and SHO saying one thing and neurologist another. Everything is electronic patient records but nothing communicated to patient and basic patient care seems to have been left at the wayside. I was away from home with no one near yet they couldn't help me downstairs to buy toothpaste or underwear etc - in fact only had a shower after i repeatedly asked the HCA on the day I said I was discharging myself if they didn't discharge me. They had run out of gowns so had to stay in same clothes for 5 days. Beds only made once a day which isn't great when you are being encouraged to stay in them not get up or into a chair. Physios were wonderful. Doctors good particularly the night one but not sure why info on what she did is not shown as GP wants to get investigated . HCAs not good. Didn't really see nurses as too busy. "

5007,"Called 111 over a worsening throat infection this evening. They had me wait for a call back from urgent care. The women who eventually called was extremely patronizing. after doubting my description of my symptoms she stated that we can give you antibiotics, which will either work or wont. Not the answer you want to hear from a medical professional. Not the right field to be doing guess work. She then accused me of getting argumentative for questioning her response and inevitably terminated the call. Since my symptoms have gotten worse. I wasnt aware you could decline people access to urgent care services due to personal opinion. Absolutely appalling, I'd be absolutely ashamed of myself had I provided this service. There should be serious consequences for this behaviour in a professional setting. As a result, the only negative consequences will be felt by myself who now has ever worsening symptoms thanks to someones personal opinion of me. I'm angered how people can be this selfish in a matter of urgent care. I'd have zero sympathy if this person lost their job, they are certainly deserving of such consequences and I can only imagine it's what is best for the service. Just absolutely dreadful. I sincerely hope something is done about this. And just pray I dont experience any worsening of pain or delay in acccessing my gp service."

6199,"Don't know - Simple but major problem In A&E - I received generally good care. Waiting time was very long. However, one absolutely crucial improvement that needs addressing ASAP - I was waiting for around 7 hours in the ambulance side of A&E. There was no access to vending machines here and the water fountain was inaccessible to waiting patients, on another part of the ward we weren't allowed into. No one offered any of the waiting patients a drink of water and some were elderly and vulnerable. It is highly dangerous to leave patients without access to hydration for hours on end and could substantially worsen some conditions. Patients have a basic right to water after hours of waiting but I had to ask a couple of times to receive a small cup. This must be addressed urgently. Also after 7 hours waiting no food was offered either. "

8098,"Terrible service. Feel let down. - Totally let down by your service. Just been told that my MBT will be ending in August not November as planned. Because I had some phone calls with my therapist last year you're classing that as part of group MBT!! Even when group MBT started in Nov last year it wasn't full MBT treatment. Throughout it's been only 3 of us but mostly just 2 of us for a majority of the time or it has been JUST ME a few times also. So not been consistent at all!! And halfway through therapy one of the therapists is leaving!! So a new one is coming in around end may / June time then more patients being added to the group. Basically true MBT will start in June time. So anyone joining then will get a full year of complete MBT where I'll have 2 months if that. So let down by your service. I'm actually coming away feeling worse than when I started and that's all because of the inconsistency and cutting my treatment to what I believe, shorter than the year I was told I'd get which was GROUP MBT. It's made me feel so suicidal now because I feel I've been messed around with again by services and not getting the treatment promised."
3891,Day treatment services - GREAT EXPERIENCE - I was very nervous attending an endoscopy but the staff were wonderful and put me at my ease. As it turned out I had nothing to worry about and it was all over quickly. The hospital is really lovely and spotless. I felt like I was having private treatment. First class from the moment I arrived until I left. Thank you. 
4281,My family member had an app. @ maternity unit for Ultra sound and we end up in wrong hospital we rang the department and explained the situation the call was responded so well and we were asked to make our way to the department. So we made it almost 2 hours late traveling Via Bus ..to our amazement the Staff were So friendly and directed to the U / S department and took us within 5 minutes....that was Unexpected by us. Congratulations was good Services.

3605,"Having never visited this hospital before, I was apprehensive given some of the poor ratings. My actual visit was fine: there's plenty of easy car parking a short walk from the hospital, it was easy to find the department I needed, I went in on time, and the staff were friendly and professional. The parking costs are in line with other hospitals I've been to."

8638,"Amazing service with amazing staff - I would like to say a massive thank you to this team for everything you have done for me. The support I received was brilliant and really did work when I really felt like there was no hope for me. I was treated with warmth, compassion, decency and respect which made my illness that bit more bearable and meant I was able to slowly begin to stand again in my journey and complete therapy. Therapy was also honest and direct again meaning I had to face myself, enabling me to learn and get better. There aren't really enough words to describe how lucky I feel to have had such wonderful support during the hardest and a truly terrifyingly worst time of my life. This service was a part of my lifeline and I can't describe how vital this support was and how much it was needed. Thank you for helping me get out of the fear and be able to see a future again. It will always, always be appreciated by myself and by my family. I would most certainly recommend this service and therapy. It really does and can work even when everything feels desperate. Again thank you "

5395,"Ophthalmology - Excellent service, the NHS at its best - Back on 21st November, I suddenly developed severe floaters in my right eye following a series of flashes a few days earlier. I have a lifelong fear of hospitals and medical procedures, but realising my eyesight was at risk if I did nothing, came to the eye casualty department. I was given a very thorough and sympathetic examination and eventually diagnosed with a retinal tear, which being in a peripheral position, had not been easy to spot. I had been frightened that I would need painful retinal surgery, but immediately reassured that the problem could be fixed with a much less invasive laser procedure to seal the tear. This was performed promptly on the same day. While I would not choose to spend 15 minutes this way, I can honestly say the treatment was not really unpleasant at all and at no time did I feel any pain. The most uncomfortable part was probably the brief stinging sensation from the necessary applications of eyedrops. I have just been discharged after 2 follow up appointments and would like to say many thanks to all the various doctors involved with my case for their professionalism, expertise and caring attitude. At a time when there has been so much negative publicity about the NHS in the media, my experience has made me realise what a precious resource it is to this country. "
7606,"I'm still having my pains in my chest, and my  legs still ache and I can hardly walk. | Nothing really, I thought your service was excellent, But I think I need to back."
9207,Recently i have been seen by Mr Douds and he's been very professional and when I was at my appointment I felt like I can trust him and I felt safe to tell him all my concerns He is more than a Gastroenterologist he is a psychologist which is very important I would highly recommend seeing this doctor for any concern.
5397,"Gynaecology - Hysteroscopy - I was very, very anxious to have this procedure but the ladies that looked after me were completely wonderful. My gynaecologist and nurses were just exemplary, a beautiful combination of professionalism and empathy.

I was admitted and have been totally looked after by all areas and departments I have visited. The staff at the Nurses Station were kind and considerate considering the pressures of finding beds for people. The staff on A&E were prompt and compassionate. The staff on the Hawthorn Ward were also fantastic, personable and incredibly caring. The consultants and doctors from ENT were also great. I think you run an amazing service and all of the team from cleaners to Consultants that I have had contact with during my visit have been nothing but faultless. Thank you. "
120,"Children's & Adolescent Services - Faultless care and attention - My son came in with acute abdominal pain. We were seem by Children's A and E. They were extremely attentive, friendly and explained everything well to my son before any procedure needed. Saw so many helpful staff and no waiting around really at all, fantastic! We were they transferred to the Skylark ward for one nights observation. Again staff were fantastic! I was always in the loop of what was going on and nothing was too much trouble. Food offering was wonderful and was a blessing to receive an offer of food for myself as I didn't want to leave my son on his own. Thankyou, very much appreciated. The play team were great and the Lego went down a storm! People quite happily review when things are wrong. But wanted this area to know that there care was faultless and I cannot thank them enough. The only tiny improvement I could say is the night staff were quite noisy during early hours morning chatting/ laughing which made it a bit tricky to get a good nights rest. Didn't help that where we were was all open plan. But a small thing to mention compared to the great care we got! "

3515,"After putting it off for several years due to being worried about undergoing the procedure, I went to Mr Steven's to get my short-sighted vision corrected after he performed eye surgery on my mother around 12 years earlier. I was recommended LASEK Wavefront treatment, and it was done at the end of May 2021. Mr Steven's, and all of the staff who performed the various tests, were very nice, made me feel very reassured and could answer all questions which I had. They were also very prompt at going through all the tests so it didn't take long at all! The procedure itself only lasted approximately 5 minutes per eye and, despite my anxieties, Mr Steven's did a fantastic job. As well as this, all other staff involved were very good. The aftercare team were also really good. I received check-up text messages and emails very regularly, and whenever I emailed with a question I got a reply extremely quickly, often within 20 minutes of sending an email. At my four month check-up after surgery I had all the pre-surgery tests repeated and, once again, the staff were amazing. I was told that I now exceed 20/20 vision, and it is incredible having gone from wearing glasses everyday to seeing crystal clear! Mr Steven's then confirmed that my eyes had healed successfully, and that it isn't even noticeable that I had the surgery in the first place! As I'm sure everyone says, I wish I had done it sooner! I would fully recommend Mr Steven's, and have already recommended him to everyone I know who is currently considering eye surgery."
222,"I was home again within 2 hours of arrival at RSCH having been assessed, x-rayed & treated. All the staff were lovely, kind & sympathetic. It was quiet in the department and no one seemed stressed or anxious. They had time for me & I appreciated it. Thank you. Please pass on my gratitude."

4896,"Gynaecology - Unnecessarily Rude - After waiting from the moment I woke up until 2pm to find out if I'm miscarrying I entered the Gynecology department as instructed the midwife and was told to sit in the waiting area. After half an hour I approached the nurse at the front to check that I was on the list to be seen as no-one had taken any details from me. She responded in a rude and aggressive manner so I reminded her that all I wanted to know if whether I was on the list and sat back in the waiting room. 5 mins later a different nurse called me to be seen. The original nurse (in front on the whole waiting room) stopped me and said 'don't take her, that lady is before her'. I sat back down, it is now 4.15pm and I am still worried and waiting to be seen."

I explained I was not happy to leave my husband alone in this state in the waiting room so I complained to the head nurse who was very nice and said I could stay with him!! he eventually got seen and was admitted and I was refused to be allowed to see him very shocking experience no empathy or discretion from the staff all they seem interested interested in is asserting authority over covid regulations and making people feel worse. the whole experience was awful we was there for over 6 hours in total"

5302,"It's excellent and terrible at the same time. - Let me explain my title statement. The dialysis unit is Excellent, the staff are second to none, every staff member is friendly and very professional. The unit itself is pleasant, and easy to access. Having dialysis here is to be recomended, although Kings Collage hospital who run it do seem to have some unexplainable protocols at times compared to other non Kings unit. But nothing that detracts from excellent care you receive within the unit for renal failure. Heres where the 'Terrible' part come in. Renal care is Excellent unless you need to see a doctor. The doctors are informed when a patient has a renal based problem, and the either refuse to attend or make an appointment to see the patient, then just don't turn up! This happens time and time again, sometimes for weeks on end, while the patient just suffers the problem, the nurses get let down in exactly the same way. That's for renal issues, but if you have other medical issues, and need to be reffered to another department, you have absolutely no chance. The nurses do their best to compensate fo the failure of the doctors (Consultants) who constantly claim to be to busy (which may well be true) to see the patients under their care, but its quite obvious that they get frustrated too at times too. Do to sum up, its a first class unit in every way, but sadly let down by its own doctors. "

7754,"Haematology - Interpretation - Due to Corona circumstances, all the appointments became through the phone. I am not an English speaker, and when the doctor contacted me I did not understand . He rebooked me again and also was no interpreter on the phone, so I did not understand what is my problem. I have the same experience at many of your Blackburn Hospital. Doctors contact patients without translation even interpreter has been requested . "

Only one machine available. Note that I stayed clear of the Hospital from the start of the pandemic.Inside, outlets such as Costa and M&S should be closed or fully-screened and ventilated. Walking the hallways, too many people walking around as though there were no pandemic. Except for the masks. That includes staff who should be setting an example. Too much equipment stored along hallways making it impossibl"

1137,"Minor injuries unit - Rude and unprofessional - Visited the vale with my boyfriend who had discomfort to his chest, rang the bell and was meet by a nurse who was very pleasant and friendly, triaged and then seen by another emergency nurse practitioner. She was very rude and forthcoming, had moaned that I shouldn't be there and it's probably nothing. Had an ECG which showed some slight changes but nothing to worry about . The emergency nurse then said in about voice and very rude that it's a good job you don't need an ambulance as I would miss my tea and I'd be very annoyed. I know the service is under immense pressure but to be spoken to and made to feel I shouldn't attend is pretty disappointing. My boyfriend was made to look an idiot. I won't be attending there again I will go to Stroud where they are much more patient and professional "

Very caring and taking thorough tests of my brother. Although I can't see him, I know that my brother is in good care - every update is consistent and staff constantly know his information and I can call at ANY time of day for an update. As with most hospitals, the main issue is expensive parking but they do have a 30 minute drop-off car park which helped as we did need to speak to a doctor in person about his status."

Thats not the hospitals fault of course but with a lack of mental health services, A&E is the only place to go and staff should see mental health as being important. "
3550,I felt unsupported by mental health services - I feel unsupported let down by pennine care.. Wife in distress rang cpn who told me ring psych secretary as the gp won't do it. Short supply meds just to calm her down while she's going through a distressing time. Psych secretary told me I shouldn't be doing this it's a cpns job. send email to pysch.. Rang cpn back explained.. I rang up needed support help by the end of the day no further on left to me to cope also wife to cope.. What I could see cpn did try..to get anything out of gp if u get through. Explains national emergency etc etc. Gets all complicated.. taken off meds put back on same meds etc.. Think pennine care is letting down my wife as a person with mental health also us carers.

Yes, I am a bit OCD, not because of COVID, either. They tendered to my needs without complaining, they just understood. Even when I got home, they called me to make sure all was well. You can't get any more personal than that. I have to say I am not nervous about going their again, as I attended the Venetian MRI today, and they were just as brilliant. During such troubled times, it's nice to know people care, and they do.Thanks so much again. "

We as a family believe he was transferred there this week approximately 12 md. His partner could not get anyone to answer the phone that day to ascertain how he was or get any update on his condition. After trying till approx 3pm the next day and still no calls being answered re an update my husband called the complaints department and a couple of hours later a nurse called his partner to update her. Today she has Tried to call all day- no answer. My father in law (80years old) called today, eventually someone answered then hung up. We live approx 500miles away. I'm horrified that no one will answer to provide an update on the his care. I appreciate staff are busy but this is unacceptable. We still have no idea how he is several days after admission."

8347,"There seemed to be little control at outpatients entrance to RSCH over who could enter the building. People were coming in to buy coffees or use toilet without anyone checking if they had an upcoming appointment. Young lad sat there but looked overwhelmed and over rum. Multiple Empty boxes of masks strewn all over table and was a worrying welcome to the hospital that seemed dishevelled and poorly managed. No one to direct you to sanitiser and suprised there was not temperature check and made me worry hygiene / safety not a priority, in contrast to going to GP practice where it was much more controlled."

5621,"A and E wait times awful when an ambulance has brought you in for breathing problems and asthma and tested positive for covid. I was in a separate room for covid patients and a woman and new born baby got told to come into this room even though they didn't have covid or symptoms. Got told to go back into the covid room as I was spreading the virus this was done in a nasty way. The staff in the assessment ward spoke and understood very little English. This ward was clean however the covid ward - ward 14 wasn't kept to a clean standard. The shared bathroom and toilets weren't cleaned thoughroughly. Toilet seats were stained and dirty. Snot, dirty socks and used PPE was on the floor in the bathroom all day. I decided I needed a shower that night so asked someone to remove the socks. Patients were pressing their buzzer alarms however it took them sometimes over 15 minutes to attend to them. The staff were quite rude didn't want to be there, if it wasn't their job they didn't do it. No TV's / radio on covid ward 14. I was very disappointed in the lack of care given by most of the staff. They basically took their time in doing anything. It wasn't clean. The staff were rude. Also the covid waiting room at A and E didn't have windows/ ventilation or air purifier so I was sat there for 6 hours with a mask on with no fresh Air coming in no tv no radio just sat on a hard plastic chair with breathing problems and low oxygen!

6483,"Don't know - Fern Ward - I was suffering from a psychotic episode resulting in the attempt to take my life. I was taken to Fern Ward. My stay there was a week. I have never suffered from mental health issues before, or been taken to such a place. A lot of what I experienced would not be fair to impart on this medium, as I was suffering psychosis and my view of some incidents impaired by this. It seemed a shame that the facilities there and the quality of comfort not great. It was somewhat prison like in its patient rooms. I suffer with my back and could not sleep at all, the mattress made of rubber and the bed base a wooden plinth, made for very uncomfortable rest, and being a woman in a certain age criteria, caused me to sweat profusely without adequate ventilation. There was a huge tv and dvd selection under lock and key which was never facilitated to anyone. Movie afternoon would have been a great idea. More arts and crafts, puzzles etc? Not an awful lot to do except stare out to an enclosed garden that we weren't allowed to use. Being sectioned I wasn't allowed out, only if I smoked? So a bit of fresh air in the garden may have been helpful. Days in confinement can be long, with no means to get out. The last day I was there, a goody trolley came round where you could purchase treats. One day a week, not helpful. All in all the staff were amazing, I was a senior manager for a blue chip company in London, and understand responsibility, and trying to be all things to a variety of situations. Just a little more attention to detail, and remember that we are just ordinary people that have come across a problem in life and need guidance and help. Not to be treated as one but as individuals with separate needs. "

Everything was explained to me and everyone was courteous and professional."

5259,I tried many times to phone and get results post excision of a skin lesion - nobody answers the phone at the dermatology department.

She meant to be proposed with a treatment plan today and they forgot to pass her records and she needs to wait now another week as the doctors meetings take only place on Mondays. Shocking. Last week we came on Friday morning and we were only send from until to unit and they told us after 2h to go home as they don't know what to do and need to wait for doctors and we need to wait for a call ... She is in pain and they do nothing!

1915,"Yesterday (11.11.21) I attended the day surgery at Redcar hospital to have surgery on a badly cut finger. The surgeon was held up at James Cook and it became apparent as time went on, that my operation may have to be cancelled. The staff went above and beyond to help me. They arranged for my surgery to happen that day at James Cook so I didn't have have it delayed further. Two staff went with me and were there right through the procedure and held my hand and talked me through surgery. I know they worked late so this could happen and I am so incredibly grateful to them. The nursing team at Redcar and James Cook and the surgeon were wonderful. I can't thank them all enough. I was given the option to make a complaint but I really don't feel in light of how I was cared for from start to finish it warrants anything other than the highest praise. Thank you all so very much.

6667,"Longest wait to see a Doctor to date - I had to endure a 10 hour wait to see a Doctor, not including any scans or tests that needed to be done adding further to the overall time spent at the Hospital. This has to be worst Trust I have been to in 20 years. I appreciate things are tougher than usual and pressure at Hospitals is at an all time high but waiting for more or less half a day to be seen isn't acceptable by any standard. "

6595,Don't know - Nightmare in patient stay - Had a unfortunate in patient stay last month on the AMU ward it was a nightmare due to staff lack of understanding of my disabilities and learning difficulties. Wasn't ideal ward to be put on. Rather go home unwell than repeat a similar stay on AMU.

I was recommended them by my GP after being diagnosed with severe panic disorder and was having multiple panic attacks a day which was resulting in me barely leaving the house. Through constant support and informative but caring structure my therapist soon taught me ways to managing this and regaining my life back. There was no pressure of rushing and took everything at my own pace (very slowly) after a fair amount of sessions I am now back to my old self. I worked with my CBT therapist once a week and I am so thankful I reached out for help, it was more support than I could have ever imagined. Thank you so much to Time to talk, it is something I will forever appreciate and be grateful for. "

7620,"Major trauma - Excellent service - My daughter was taken into hospital for chest pains via ambulance, she was taken into majors. The staff were so hardworking kind and patient with her. She suffers from high functioning autism and gets extremely anxious. I was so impressed with how they took their time to explain clearly and gently what was going to be done in terms of procedures. I feel so grateful to all of them for their help from the nurses to the doctors...each and every one of them were very patient and calm and kind and being very clear in the way they spoke to her. Thank you Whipps Cross! "

505,Poor practice - I was told I had wasting time despite having occurred fracture to my arm they just went on to tell me how busy they were and that they don't have time for smaller injuries I also heard tastes being discussed by two receptionists.

4695,"Don't know - Ewhurst Ward Staff are Amazing - Our Mum was admitted to Ewhurst ward for what turned out to be her end of life care. We were blown away by the way the doctors, nurses and ancillary staff dealt with her and us. The compassion showed to mum was truly wonderful. The empathy and understanding shown in their communications with her children was more than we could ever have expected. We were allowed to sit with our mother through her last hours, we felt honoured that they made the effort to make this happen for us during these incredibly trying times in hospital during COVID. We feel blessed by their concern and care and we do not have enough words to express the depths of our gratitude. Thank you to you all, you are truly wonderful people providing exemplary practical and spiritual care in the hardest of times."

6327,Helpful staff | Communication of progress
4168,1 the care and expertise was exceptional | I went in to hospital on Friday evening for a prostate removal operation on Saturday. Everything that was going to happen was explained in great detail. The nurses were magnificent the operation took place Saturday afternoon and I was allowed to leave hospital Sunday afternoon with all the pain killers needed to manage and the follow up care in place. Just brilliant.
4259,Slow and unorganised. Good luck if you goto A&E. Minimum wait time is 2+hours just to see someone. You will need to explain yourself to a myriad of people as no communication at all.
8464,"I phoned to speak to someone in the Xray department using the General switch board. I was left holding on till I was disconnected 4 times. Each time holding on for a considerable amount of time the longest being over 30 minutes. The Switchboard Operators were indifferent and when on my third attempt I tried to explain what was happening, I was just put through to the extension again to wait it out before I could put two words together. Had the Operator listened to me I just wanted to ask for the direct extension number for the department so that I could try phoning directly. This is very bad service when you consider that people phoning in, more likely than not, have medical issues and this behaviour by the Switchboard Operators is not helpful. As a patient you are told to make sure you contact the hospital as soon as possible when any adjustments to your appointment need to be made, and you are indeed reminded of the huge cost involved for not doing so. For this reason, I persevered when it could have been so much easier to just stop trying. Before writing this, I noted wonderful reviews on this hospital by other people and I shall be attending this hospital to see if this really is the case because my experience so far has been unfriendly."
3919,Could not fault any member if staff | Nothing 
9448,Cardiology department - It took 15 phone calls over 2 days to finally talk to someone. They kept putting me through to the department but no one answered. I appreciate you are understaffed but someone who is ill cannot wait 2 days before anyone takes notice of the phone.

1875,"As soon as I arrived I was met by a very friendly, kind and efficient male nurse (Ken) who also gave me all the pre procedure care. Another very caring female nurse (sorry, forgotten her name) brought me to the endoscopy room, introduced me to the staff in the room. It gave me a wonderful feeling of confidence and I felt completely relaxed. The post procedure care was equally kind and caring . The whole experience was positive and I felt that my well being was important to all who cared for me. A huge Thank you to all, including the lady who brought me a tea and sandwich."

2000,"A unexpected visit - I was referred immediately to the Western following a routine eye test. My visit filled me with admiration for all the staff I came into contact with. Several members of Staff dealt with me, from the person on the door, to the Administrative Staff in the A & E Department, to the Nurse who tested my eyes, the one who did the scan and the Doctor who explained everything to me. I was reassured at every stage of care I went through, treated kindly, politely and professionally. The amount of people who were being seen was incredible and no-one on the staff seemed harassed, weary, intolerant or abrupt. Well done to them all."
7299,"1 Telephone consultation replacing routine visit- excellent  I had a routine appointment with a consultant, blood test two weeks in advance. Appointment was results feedback-no examination required. Saved me a trip to Guildford (say 1 hr travel time) parking, waiting for appointment. Also (in normal times) I would not have had to reschedule a meeting."

692,This week #MentalHealthAwareness about showing #kindness. Sadly did not experience this @BHR_hospitals when I took my 19 month son to your A&E today adviced by #GP. Your clinical lead was rude and unkind. Will be taking this up formally. Don't blame #COVID19 for poor #Management

5307,"My mum was a patient at this hospital for 4 separate occasions over 2 months. She had been in A&E, Gastrology, Intensive care and a Covid ward. A couple days before Christmas, she caught Covid and was taken into hospital by Ambulance on Christmas Eve, this hospital saved her life and for that we are all very thankful. The paramedics, doctors and nurses she dealt with were lovely and professional, despite the unprecedented times we were in and still are experiencing. She is now doing really well and the aftercare has been excellent. Thank you to all at William Harvey, you have done a tremendous job and we are all very grateful. Thank you A ++++++"

7338,Very professional and attentive.
9281,"Not helpful - I first rang Sutton Uplift in a state of severe anxiety in January. I quickly had an assessment with a really fantastic person who was very kind and spend a lot of time with me. I then waited 2 months for an appointment, and had 3 CBT appointments. It wasn't really working, so I was told I would receive different treatment, and I was temporarily discharged. That was 2 months ago and I have not heard anything since. I understand there are resource constraints, but I have been left in the lurch in a vulnerable position. I also had a very difficult conversation with someone from Sutton Uplift on the phone who was very rude to me, and as a result, I spent the rest of the day in a very anxious state. Really not what I called a mental health support line for. I think Sutton Uplift is trying its best, but I really would not recommend this for anyone looking for support with their mental health. I have the experience more harm than help. "
400,I thought that Dr Catherine James was caring and excellent.
8059,"Accident and emergency services - Yet another disappointing visit - I am my husband's carer, he is a kidney dialysis patient, diabetic, has very limited vision and has suffered strokes. He was taken by ambulance to the WHH with chest and gut pain, he spent all night sat on a chair and discharged the following morning as nothing wrong with him how can they assume that when the WHH has been continually cancelling appointments pretty much monthly since January to investigate his gut pain. As his carer I telephoned to ask which of his regular morning medications had they given him (to avoid overdosing) the reply was none not even his insulin the excuse given was I only came on shift at 8am I asked to please check what the previous shift had given him and again nothing she then hung up. By the time my husband arrived home he was at least 2 hours 15mins late for his first morning insulin not surprisingly his blood sugar reading was a very low 2.2 he had been offered nothing to drink all night, no breakfast and no assistance to find or use the toilet. They made no attempt to contact me at any time with an update or to tell me they were sending him home or he was on his way home. Treating vulnerable patients with such total disregard isn't acceptable, ever. Feeling very disappointed, frustrated and angry yet again."
195,"My son went onto ward 77 on a Tuesday after being sent home on Monday and we had to return as he was really poorly with the same symptoms. So far after spending 8 days there they still have no diagnosis, he has been subjucted to a feeding tube down his throat, which 45 mins later after a scan was told he didnt need. He has had meds hours after expected time, Dr decided after 7 days to test for coeliac, crohns and gastritus even after surgoens discharged him after day 2 saying it was not surgical. Meds delayed til midnight every night meaning Ruben and his mum have had to stay awake or be woken when they are both exhausted. One nurse was horrible and accused mum of turning his drip machine off when it was a doctor who pressed the wrong button, no apologie from nurse. She Ignored requests for a drinks for mum and ruben. Didnt feed mum on one night, didnt bring her evening meal, i had to drive down to the hospital with food whilst trying to care for an autistic boy at home. Ruben requested food on day 7 and was told by nurses they need to ask the doctor before he eats, still waiting on the morning of day 8 to see if he can eat despite mum constantly asking. Blood tests requested day 7 for coeliac, still waiting 19 hours later. Hospital has neglected and caused uneccessary pain to my autistic son throughout his stay and he will never be returning to this hospital, i will also be seeking legal advice."

5304,"Excellent care and treatment - In April I was admitted to Ramsay (Horton General) with a tibia plateau fracture. I received the most amazing care and attention from everyone (my Surgeon, Anaesthetist, Physio, Occupational Therapist, Nurses, Outpatient Doctors and Reception Staff) I came in contact with during my hospital stay and my post op recovery. Before I left hospital, the doctors, nurses, OT and Physio made sure I had the support I needed to manage when I left hospital. I received amazing support and encouragement to walk again and my healing went exactly to plan under their guidance. It could have been a really depressing 3 months before I was able to walk unaided, but with their help, I managed extremely well. Staff were always very positive and reassuring and I was treated very much as an individual and felt very well looked after. I rarely waited for appointments and was assisted by Staff (without asking for help) because of my lack of mobility. I've been back working full time for a few months now and have had no issues at all. I wouldn't have recovered so quickly without the friendly manner, care, assistance, support and concern shown to me by all. Not being mobile was more difficult than I could have imagined, but the Staff had prepared me for what to expect. I'm pain-free and very happy and would like to thank all those who were responsible for my treatment and quick recovery. I received follow up calls and letters to check on my progress and will be forever grateful. "

A staff member that went out of their way to approach us in the car park as we were about to buy a car parking ticket unnecessarily as it was out of charging hours. And the staff that served me in A&E reception were very efficient and dealt with me in a very polite and efficient manner. Thank you. Finding a way to feed this back to the hospital was probably more challenging!! "
3483,"Accident and emergency services - Excellent staff - My elderly father was in Acute Assessment Unit 2 when I visited yesterday, suffering from pneumonia. He is very deaf and easily disorientated and confused. The staff were phenomenal; true professionals with a wonderful human touch; it was clear the ward sister was brilliant at keeping on top of everything and was respected and loved by all. She made sure her staff were well cared for. In turn, her nursing staff were highly competent and were very respectful and kind to my dad and all surrounding patients. They never got frustrated or impatient. My father's named nurse was a very hard-working quick-thinking individual. He was so good at his job that he never seemed to get a moment's peace-colleagues and patients needed him. Equally impressive was the Patient Transport driver. He was extremely thoughtful, kind and generous. He was very respectful of his patients and took pride in their comfort. I know the NHS is under strain, and one could see the workload was huge, but these people really showed a dedication to their vocation which made everything work beautifully. Thank you all from all the family."

I called as I was concerned that I had started bleeding again even though I had a scan to say all products had gone and the bleeding had stopped. The lady I spoke to was not helpful are reassuring just kept telling me to take a pregnancy test and would not explain why it was happening. As I have never had a miscarriage before I do not k ow what to expect. This is not the first time the staff EPU have been rude and rush me on the phone and in person. The staff need more training in how to communicate with patients. Awful staff!

7770,"Maternity services - Mixed review - I was in the hospital from 24th August until the 2nd September for the birth of my son, I felt very looked after as I had an induction, the staff were friendly and helpful. Once I eventually went into labour I was left on the ward overnight as there were no beds on the delivery suite and I was told there was a bit of a wait, this is not any of the staffs fault and I know they were trying their best to move me as soon as possible. Once I was moved the midwife that was there for the birth was absolutely fantastic and will forever appreciate how lovely she was. After my son was born we had around 5 hours in the delivery suite, and then I was to be moved downstairs into the ward, this is the first time I tried to move and realised that I couldn't because of a pain in my pelvis. The midwife was helpful and got me dressed and managed to find a wheelchair to get me downstairs. Once I was on the ward this is where I started to feel let down, I know the staff are busy but I felt like I wasn't listened to about the pain. I originally had a caffiter fitted but then a few hours later this was removed, I asked the midwife if there was a wheelchair or crutches I could use to get around and she just said no and I would need to walk to the toilet (I literally couldn't move, i couldn't get in or out of bed by myself or lift my feet off the floor once I was standing, and she knew that) A few hours later someone else came to my bed with a team of paediatricians, she didn't tell me who she was but I'm assuming a midwife, she very quickly told me that they needed to do some tests on my baby and they could do it right now, she didn't tell me what they were doing and was very rushed. She then asked when the last time the baby ate was and it turned out it was about 8 hours ago, I was understandably so tired from the last few days that I had just not thought about feeding him and nobody had said anything and baby wasn't crying or anything. She got really annoyed that it had been so long and took one of the bottles of formula from the side and asked me for a bottle, I wanted to breastfeed but she said there wasn't time and went on to feed him a bottle of formula. I found this really upsetting and was clearly emotional and wish I had said something but at the time didn't because I wanted to do what was right for him, they then took him off for tests for 5 hours! I was moved to transitional care where nobody could tell me how long it would be until they brought him back. After 5 hours he was returned and I stayed on transitional care for 4 days where the staff were brilliant and looked after me and baby very well. It's been 5 weeks and the thought of the time on the ward still makes me emotional, I know the staff are so busy but I want them to just take a bit of time to explain things and ask the mums opinion on things because as a new mum I was so emotional and exhausted that I really didn't need someone treating me like an idiot. Sorry for the long review!! "
8407,"Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery - Fantastic experience - I have experienced a very slick refferal experience to oral surgery, culminating in a biopsy procedure on the roof of my mouth this morning. Many thanks to the consultant who saw me at an initial appointment, three weeks ago. A clear explanation of the process was given then. Today, a different consultant and support team gave me very detailed advice about the process, which was performed easily and swiftly. I felt totally at ease, and was given clear advice for the days ahead. I now look forward to my follow up appointment in approximately four weeks time. Well done, Sunderland Royal Hospital.

1510,The Opthalmology department is fantastic. Also had Gynaecology surgery for removal of a dermoid Cyst on my ovary and endometriosis staff soo much better than Leighton Hospital. If you live between Leighton and Royal Stoke always choose Stoke. Had loads of problems with Leighton.
2495,Accident and emergency services - Terrible - Took my son as his tooth had broken off and imbedded itself in his cheek he couldn't eat or move his mouth the triage nurse said there was nothing they could do and to go see a dentist (it's a Sunday eve) she could book him in but would wait 3 hours for nothing told him to take more painkillers I understand the situation we are in but this is not right surely they could of removed the tooth from the cheek to ease some pain. Over the last two months 3 of my family that were told to attend a&e have been sent away disappointed with no treatment this is not the service we pay for

7726,"A big thank you to the team that picked me up from St Mary's Birth Centre and transferred me to QMC on Sunday 17th May, in the early hours of the morning. Things had started to go wrong for us and I was in agony. The lady paramedic that sat in the ambulance next to me (slim, dark hair and tats) held my hand the whole way. Such a simple gesture and yet it meant the world and kept me grounded when I was struggling so much. Thank you to that lady üíñ"
6472,"Appalling practice with appalling customer service - I have been waiting for a call back for nearly 3 weeks over an urgent medication issue. I keep leaving voicemails, but never have my calls returned. It feels as though Cygnet House has a complete lack of care for the needs of patients that have been referred to them."
1275,"I was seen on time and it was an early appointment at 8.30. Thankfully I had left very early as the traffic was awful and there were road works by the hospital. When I arrived there was a nurse or nurse assistant taking many phone calls from people clearly stressed that they would be late. She was patient, kind, sympathetic, reassuring and must have been aware of how the difficulties of the day would from now on unfold with a backlog of waiting patients who would arrive late. These are the people who make the service of the NHS so valuable. We are lucky to have you all. The surgeon was clear with the upco"

1147,My wife was referred to the hospital by our doctor in late October. We received a letter on 5th of December to tell us that it would take 12 weeks to get an appointment.At the end of January I phoned the hospital to find out how much longer we had to wait.The person I spoke to was not at all helpful.We eventually got an appointment on 10th February. My wife was assessed and we were told she was suffering with Altzeimers. We were told the paperwork would go through to the person who deals with the medication it would take 2 weeks to be sorted. After 3 weeks I phoned to see what was going on. I got no satisfaction. I called again 2 days later still nothing. Eventually I was called and told my wife would get her medication on 27th March. It has taken 4 months to get satisfaction and I think it is absolutely disgusting for people to be treated this way. If all their patients are dealt with the same way then God help us all

6165,"Holistic care - I attended for an outpatient appointment and the care I received was top notch. The doctors that saw me treated me as a whole, seeing the complaint I had come for as part of the whole picture of my life.

9959,Good polite and staff efficiently handled
7439,"Interventional Radiology - Poor communication skills - Having recently endured a year of cancer treatment including major surgery, I went to the radiology department at Ealing Hospital for a mammogram on the remaining (hopefully) healthy breast. I waited patiently and for some considerable time pending the analysis until my name was called. A woman then ushered me into a room and basically barked at me CHAIR! in a most unwelcoming manner and I could only wonder if I was now a performing seal rather than a member of society and / or cancer patient. They proceeded to tell me they were a doctor and provided some very basic topline information indicating all was apparently fine. Despite their initial extremely abrupt manner I remained polite, thanked them and indicated the information was reassuring but noted they also couldn't be bothered to reply, say goodbye or anything to show any level of patient interest or care. For information this apparent sub species self detected their cancer whilst mammograms both in 2018 and at the time of self discovering one of three tumours, all reported false negatives. I hope for the sake of future patients some form of communication skills are swiftly introduced for such medical professionals. I am sure if such individuals ever have to endure cancer treatment themselves they will expect to receive some level of kindness and empathy rather than being barked at and treated as some sub species. I also recall in the waiting area, very discreetly hidden under some magazines, hand cleanser and wipes a hint of a board with feedback forms - it's doubtful anyone every completes them as they are so discreetly placed / hidden from view. Thankfully most of my treatment has been of a much higher level under the Imperial Trust where feedback is routinely sought of every patient, even those deemed to be performing seals, and the standard of communication is far superior to anything I experienced this afternoon."

3449,"Absolutely disgusted with the way you have treated my grandmother. She was taken in by ambulance yesterday at 4.15pm with a severe infection. At 7pm you called to say you were sending her home without waiting for any results. Today the GP rang at 3pm to say she needs to go back to hospital her bloods were completely all over the place. Shame on you. A safeguarding will be going in tomorrow you have completely traumatised my grandmother, left bruising from mauling her and neglected her against your duty of care."

The consultant, assisted by nurses, carried out the operation to remove a Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC). The procedure took less than an hour and apart from the pinpricks of the anesthetic injections was completely pain-free. I have nothing but praise for the consultant and her nurses. I was made to feel at ease and at no time was I less than confident in their expertise. Thank you all."

So proud of our NHS, especially since my feelings towards it had waned somewhat recently for various reasons. The reality is, is that it provides a top quality service when you need it most and you never know when you will, but it is so reassuring to know that this marvellous institution is there at our time of need providing a truly incredible world class service to our loved ones.

6530,Everyone is so kind and helpful.
5121,Accident and emergency services - Poor service - So I wasn't feeling well for at least 3-4 days went in to A&E told the nurse my symptoms. Straight away they told me that i had COVID-19. I argued that I didn't have it. Got tested and results came back negative. All this time i had been struggling to breath and my neck was very painful from the inside. My ears were on fire but the 3rd time i went back to Rotherham A&E a doctor attended to me at the door and informed me that I was not allowed in and he had to do an assessment at the door. I informed him that I didn't have a sore throat there was more to it but he was rude and refused to let me in to be seen. I ended up going to Northern general hospital where a doctor discovered that my tonsils were inflamed and i needed antibiotics. Honestly speaking I understand that there is a lot of pressure due to Covid-19 but things could have been handled differently and i could have been seen by a professional who would have listened to me and sort out the problem i had at hand. Please improve the service so that people get adequate care. Thank you

They apologized repeatedly for the long wait, they explained the situation, they treated the patients with absolute kindness, and worked in a very conscientious way.

788,"There were long waiting times, and three different receptionists asked me the same question before I could see a nurse. The music played in the waiting room was too loud, my husband wasnt allowed in the hospital with me even though people were there with others. Equipment was used multiple times and wasnt cleaned between patients. I was seen by a nurse, and she was rough in her examinations which caused me audible pain. She then took my blood pressure reading which was unsurprisingly high. The doctor gave me painkillers on an empty stomach, which caused me to vomit when I came home."
2664,"Orthopaedics - Very good people but failed to administer analgesia on time - Recommend the care but pain management following surgery was very poor. Our care during pre op was excellent but after coming from surgery, no initiative from the staff to relieve pain for my 15 year old .I asked twice for pain control got paracetamol and Ibuprofen but not had any relief.

6804,"Absolute nightmare. I know we are in hard and difficult times currently but waiting in AandE is ridiculous. Came here about 3 this afternoon after being advised to by a doctor at Trafford General. Waited 5 hours, checked with reception there was still 8 people in front of me to be seen had to leave for work. After talking with my boss was allowed to leave to come back. Returned about midnight to be informed approx 7 hour wait. Just have to sit and wait this time. I know hospitals are under a lot of pressure and I sympathise. But 7 hours cmon. I feel really bad leaving this review especially considering it is a very good standard and all the staff are nice and good at their job. Just waiting times"

3540,"Orthopaedics - Received exceptional care for a hand infection - I would like to thank all of the staff in the minor injuries and orthopaedic departments for the exceptionally good care that I received on 6th/7th May 2021. They treated an infection to my finger that had rapidly got worse overnight, making me visit the minor injuries department. The treatment and medication was explained clearly to me all the way through, including an overnight stay for IV antibiotics. The doctor's knowledge, treatment and manor was exceptional and he came back to visit me the following morning on the ward. The other staff that supported me, including nurses and others was just as good. I particularly wish to thank a nurse / doctor at the minor injuries dept. who stayed late to ensure I was treated before he went home (I'm not supposed to mention names in this review, sorry). Thank you all!! "

5002,"Children's & Adolescent Services - Fabulous staff - My daughter had her teeth extracted - she was looked after on Peanut Ward - I just wanted to say that the staff are absolutely amazing. They made us welcome, explained everything and were kind and compassionate throughout. I am truly overwhelmed and cannot thank them enough. "
5464,
186,"Accident and emergency services - Great care - Was advised to go to A&E after accidentally walking into a glass door and splitting nose open which also causes a lot of swelling. The nurse who cared for me whilst I was at A&E was exceptional! She was kind, thorough, reassuring and went above and beyond. Even in these extremely busy and pressured times the Nurses and Doctors care is just outstanding and whilst they are under huge amounts of pressure still remain calm and listen to you. The nurse tonight was simply amazing and a real credit to the NHS. We should all appreciate these people that go above and beyond to care for us. Thank you to Pinderfields A&E this evening and particularly the nurse who looked after me. You are all wonderful. "
9081,"Don't know - Excellent service! - Yesterday (8.8.20), I was seen by the lovely staff at minor injuries after my little boy suffered an injury to his foot whilst at Alnwick Gardens. The nurse who treated us was extremely professional, especially in these difficult times, and made me and my little boy feel totally at ease. We had a little wait, but that's to be expected and I was truly happy with the care he received. She even managed to make him smile. Please pass my thanks again onto the nurse. "
4293,Went for surgery here and it was a great patient experience from start to finish. Helpful friendly staff throughout.
623,"Neurology - Great care - I was diagnosed with epilepsy 5 years ago, and every appointment I have had at this hospital has been very good. The dr is friendly and really listened when I was explaining my symptoms. I'm now doing much better, and have gone from having at least one fit a day to only having two a month."

4630,"My wife was admitted with chest pains and brought into A&E. Although it took 5 hours to be seen (which is the administrative systems forced upon them, not their choice), the experience was made most pleasant by Robyn at the main A&E reception desk. She gave accurate information when asked, was delightful to deal with, and apologised for the delays several times. She even recognised me and helped me without me asking!! An experience which could have manifested into anger, but was ultimately diffused by an employee with a smile which lights up a room. Wow. She really is an asset to the team - promote this woman!! "
1862,3.The time she took arguing with me telling me she had important work to do she could have got water and helped my mum's kidneys... very poor attitude...@TorbaySDevonNHS
5560,4 hours in A and E and still not been seen and the place is quiet.Awful place with a very rude receptionist women who spends more time sorting out her kitchen fit and texting on her phone then anything else.
925,"Staff were lovely, dealt with me very quickly and efficiently. I knew what was going on all the time, my results were explained to me and I was updated on all the procedures regularly. Everything was brilliant and I would like to thank all nurses and drs."

100,"Hospital admissions at Lincoln and County Louth - I was admitted to Louth hospital for a procedure on a badly broken arm! The greeting I got was warm, I was shown / told everything I needed to know and was asked if I had any questions...after I had my procedure I was greeted by the same nurse, nothing at all was too much trouble, it was like stepping back in time, when being a nurse was something to be very proud of, all the nurses here had time for their patients unlike my experience at Lincoln hospital ...where everything seems to be too much bother and everyone I met seemed angry! I was forgotten 3 times during my visit with my broken arm! Where there wasn't anybody to plaster my arm, where I was left 4. 5 hours one time after I had asked for pain relief! Louth hospital gets the thumbs up from me, and if I ever have to make the choice over which hospital to go into, it certainly won't be Lincoln after my experiences! "
2897,Absolutely appalled by the care I received as a patient at this hospital. The staff are some of the most unprofessional disrespectful people I have ever had the misfortune to come across. The way that I was spoken to by a member of staff is appalling and absolutely nothing this hospital can say or do will ever be good enough now the trust in this place has gone. If you want a hospital that is going to care for you as a patient and treat you with dignity and respect I do not recommend this one.
2970,"Jo Walter was just rude, refusing to answer any of my questions, trying to finish the phone call asap, frightening me with very long delay to get a traitement."

9500,my son was in hospital the paediatric ward and had two nurses help us who were brilliant Teresa and Michelle . So good with my son and made him feel at ease they were friendly and kind and good at there job. They took there time and made sure my son felt safe. And the drs also checked up on my son once we left the hospital and they were also brilliant .

I initially chose Warwick as had horrific experience in Coventry. I am super happy I made the decision to deliver my baby here. Beautiful, caring and professional staff. Appointments were always on time, labour was just simply amazing and I was soo well looked after after. I couldn't be happier. Thank you for making this experience memorable in the most positive way.

3995,"STAFF ARE TOLD TO LEAVE REVIEWS, STAFF ON THE FRONT DESK TREAT PATIENTS LIKE THEY ARE ANIMALS AND MAKE THE EXPIRENCE HORRIBLE. POOR MANAGEMENT TEAM, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND WORKING THERE! MOST PATIENTS WILL BE SENT HOME EVENTHOUGH THEY MAY BE IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE JUST TO BRING THE NUMBERS DOWN, YOU WILL BE TOLD THAT A DOCTOR WILL CALL YOU AND DECIDE IF YOU NEED TO GO BACK. EXPOSED!!! "
8702,"Harris Birthright Centre Fetal Medicine reception - I've visited the fetal medicine centre multiple times for scans for my two pregnancies and I have to say the reception staff (who have been the two same women for all of my scans in the last 8 months) have been abrupt, unhelpful and often rude. They made no effort to greet me or help with enquiries - when I asked them questions they made it clear that it's an effort / annoyance and offered very little in terms of responses. It's generally yes / no answers, making no eye contact, and seeming reluctant to offer help with what I was asking or need. Having been sat in the waiting room for a while waiting for appointments, I've watched how they interact with other patients and it's has been the same - rude and unhelpful. Plus, when they're not speaking to patients they're having inappropriate discussions about their private life. They both displayed a lack of training on how to behave professionally and with empathy, especially given that some patients will be dealing with some very upsetting news and deserve some more compassion."
6615,Great practice - I went into the E&A on the 4th of June after being referred by my GP. I was overwhelmed by the service that I received even though l haven't been there for a while.I felt that l was given maximum help the staff were ready to help me treated and valued.As a person living with a number of health issues was scared that l would be stigmatised.lt was excellent just from the receptionist and all the staff covid rules in place 
2869,"Endoscopy unit - Last week I was seen in the Endoscopy unit at Doncaster Royal Infirmary. All the staff there were really caring and supportive, the service was very efficient and covid safe, and I felt very reassured afterwards. Many thanks to the team for all your amazing hard work during this difficult time! "

After waiting for 3 hours when my number came doctor told me it seems fine but I tried to explain the pain is for past 3 weeks and already seen by GP, given antibiotics and booked an ultra sound scan which is next month. Rest of the conversation was like Me - may be it's hernia Doctor- speak to your GP Me - may be bowel something...

Amazing service and I feel much more confident with attending the dentist now."

Explained to surgeon it was down at the moment but does this and then flares up again. Although I can see and feel the cyst she said she could not??? . She decided not to operate saying she needed for it to flare up again and call them when it does. Really, I waited 4 months for this op which could have been carried out. I do not wish to wait another 4 months of sometimes very painful cyst. I am going to have to go private and would suggest everyone else do the same. "

4459,"Gynaecology - Excellent care on Ward A23 - I was admitted to A23 via a&e with cellulitis. The doctors and nursing staff on the triage unit were caring, supportive and very professional and took their time to reassure me. I was then admitted to the ward (a23) and spent 3 days there for intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Every single member of staff I met during my admission were amazing, they were always available if you needed help or to answer any questions. The nursing staff were very caring and supportive and the doctors were brilliant, very knowledgeable and professional and took their time to talk to you during their ward round. Having been a student nurse previously, I can say wholeheartedly that the staff on this ward were brilliant and made a very uncomfortable and painful time due to the cellulitis easier to manage and I would like to pass on my thanks to the whole team on A23 for being so supportive during my stay on the ward.

5887,One and a half hours on the phone waiting... - How can any organisation operate where customers (aka patients) have to wait over one and half hours to even get through on the phone? This is shocking and a complete disgrace. I am glad it was not urgent.

5853,"Thank you! - I want to leave this review on behalf of my mum. Yesterday she had to unexpectedly go to Milton Keynes A&E after a visit with the doctor. My mum is pretty terrified of hospitals due to experiences and memories from childhood and so I was very upset thinking about her having to experience this alone. She spent 7 hours there in total getting various tests and scans. When she finally was able to call me that evening she told me how utterly wonderful all the staff had been and how safe and cared for she felt throughout. Considering what all NHS staff are enduring at the moment, I cannot thank you all enough, from the bottom of my heart, for taking care of my mum so well. You're amazing. "
586,The staff are simply amazing.
1460,I had a text & my blood has been issued at Charing Cross hospital. I love that they tell you where it's gone. I was once fancy enough to go to a private hospital! Someone out there actually paid for my blood...
6747,"Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery - Sympathetic and empathetic care of my autistic son - My son required oral surgery. He has autism and other issues and can become so upset that he cannot be managed. I wrote to the consultants secretary before we visited out-patients with advice on how to make the situation less stressful for him - they were excellent. They took every suggestion and used it so well that when he went in for day surgery it was very successful with his anxiety reduced to a minimum. We have had some appalling issues with hospitals in the past as my son can become very aggressive if upset, embarrassed or he feels that staff are mistreating him. The team at the Manor from secretaries, out-patients, x-ray, blood tests and day surgery are to be commended. Well done and thank you."

5216,"Children's & Adolescent Services - Awful service - My son had a blood test booked nearly a week ago over the phone. I've asked twice for the confirmation of the time so I'm pretty sure I was there at the right time. After arriving at the reception, I've been greeted by the receptionist. I had to confirm all my personal information in front of other 2 mums waiting there. No privacy whatsoever. We've told to wait on the chairs so that's what we did. After waiting more that 30 min I've asked the receptionist how long do we need to wait. She just said that they had another child there and had some issues. I've explained that I'm going to be late as I wasn't expected to have to wait for so long. They tell you to be on time for a reason. She then rudely answered and said that we were early for our appointment, that we had the wrong time. After 45 min you say that?! ? What kind of service is this? We managed to have the test done after 1 hour. I'll never book there again."
719,"Unprofessional triage nurses - After being advised by 999 team at 3am in the morning to visit a hospital within 4 hours due to viral illness, on arrival and explaining what I was told by 999 team, she looked at me and said What do you want me to do for God sake am at the hospital, access me. Afterwards the another nurse came and access me and advised me that there is a 5 hour wait or I should go back home and wait my illness out. Those words are shameful coming from a nurse "

8174,Neurology - Don't even care - Neurologist didn't bother to call me for my appointment. Just get told by staff don't know what happened. Won't allow me to be added on to end of appointments as he finishes at 3. Staying an extra ten minutes to fit me in isn't going to happen. Yet he can completely skip my appointment.

Though more can be done on being clearer on what's happing regarding my care etc. and where I should go after (though I am Autistic so I'm not sure if other Autistic people or non-Autistic have found this), no clear precise instructions and didn't help me find where I needed to go after. Autism education (and disability training overall) is so needed for people working in the NHS (though they were lovely and great otherwise, and I have a deep respect for NHS and for most who work in the NHS)."
3171,nothing nurses and hcas and staff have been great and understanding
2344,"Very attentive staff, kind, helpful, efficient, informative, caring. Could not fault them."
391,As and add on to my previous note regarding orthopaedic department I still have had no call back . Now had to ring the consultants secretary who was amazing and very professional. I found out that despite my calls and messages I was still listed as a DNA. Please...if you put a number on a letter to address appointment changes at least answer it? It's this causing the waste of appointment time and not your patients! 
1972,"Oncology - Clinical - Oustandingly awful.... avoid - If you ever have the misfortune to be diagnosed with cancer, my experience has been terrible with the head and neck team. After months of problems and agonising treatment I have been so fortunate to move my treatment to the Royal Marsden in London, which has only served to highlight the disfunctionality of this particular department in Maidstone. I am now treated with respect during my care in London and urge advice to anyone in this particular departments care to seek second opinions elsewhere. "

5201,Relaxing atmosphere lovely colours on walls. Friendly and efficient staff.
6915,"Rude Nurse Refuse to see 1year old The nurse on duty today 23/10/21 was very rude, disrespectful, unprofessional with no sympathy at all towards 1year old baby who she refuse to see just because she was 9 mins late gor her appointment. Last Saturday she was short of a vaccine for which she reschedule her appointment for the that vaccine. Today she refused to do her vaccination as we were 9mins late. She made us wait 45mins to refuse for vaccination. My daughter's immunisation has been compromised just because of her behavior. That nurse should have been trained to be respectful towards her patients especially when babies involved. Now I need to wait another week or so to complete my daughter's vaccination which she refused ti do today."
838,"Smooth, efficient, polite, friendly, and (almost) painless. Really cant fault the service at all."

6693,Grateful to all the staff at @RoyalFreeNHS for their exemplary care and @Label1tv - always caring and considerate while filming. #hospital @BBCTwo such an emotional watch. Cant help but see how lucky I am. Hoping my participation in the trial helps in this fight against #COVID19
5336,Excellent facilities and care

5462,"Accident and emergency services - A&E experience - I had occasion to be of need of assistance on Sat 28th Dec. I firstly phoned a 0300 number, after giving my details, I was advised to phone 999. In both cases I was received with very sympathetic responses. I was advised to proceed to Lancaster Hospital at the A&E dept. After being processed I was placed in the consultant's care. Although, initially, I found him rather brusque, I must say he was very efficient in processing my case, then arranging an CT scan, which proved that I hadn't had a Stroke as first feared. I was then seen by another very caring Doctor who ruled out TIA . I was then discharged feeling much relieved. I would like to thank all the staff for their attention and care that I received when I attended the LRI yesterday in a very busy dept. Please accept my grateful thanks for your help. "
5752,Fantastic specialists
7614,Amazing @AmandaC05390444 is on the desk tonight and is in charge and looking after us. One call so far @EMAS_CFR
5202,"I had my baby there it was my first pregnancy and everything was of high level standards! The staff was amazing throughout the pregnancy and even more during my labor experience, special mention to Ekaterina who was the midwife who delivered my baby girl and special mention to all the labour ward staff: the midwives, the anesthesist for my epidural, etc. Everyone was just amazing and caring. I would definitely recommend this hospital for maternity! "
5315,I have no complaints from start to finish
1601,The worst hospital I have ever been too it's got worse
2307,efficient very friendly staff doctor made a few jokes to mke me feel at ease
8453,"Felt safe at flu jab clinic during pandemic. - The clinic have been running flu jab sessions in the local church hall. When I visited I was so impressed with the choice of venue which allowed for a one way system and ample space. The staff were protected, they stuck to appointment times so there was no queue at all and they had all doors propped open so I didn't have to touch the handles. The letter we received in advance explained what was expected of us, including wearing masks. The staff were welcoming and the whole experience was stress free. Well done to the team at Coppull Medical Practice. "
1968,"A Sunday well spent!! Super grateful to have finally received my first Pfizer vaccination!! üíâü¶†So impressed with how well organised the process was, thanks @gloshospitals https://t.co/T4ueswoaVk"
314,The nurses and doctors are the best and they all lovely in St Thomas hospital
3059,"I will be forever grateful to Dr Price. After 4 miscarriages she let us try treatment that was not available to us on the NHS. Not only at every appointment did she give me hope and reassurance that we would one day have a baby, I really believe she is the reason I write this with my 10 week old baby sleeping on me! Once I was pregnant during the first lockdown BCRM let me attend multiple scans until I reached 12 weeks and they were always available to reassure me on the phone. I recommend you to everyone! Thank you so much x"
6368,Helped my husbands chronic gout and swollen knee last night and was amazing with all what's going on
8222,"Visited in December between Xmas & NY following a fall. I had my wrist checked and was told it appeared to be a sprain, and I was given a splint and told to take pain killers. Following further treatment back in West Yorkshire, it transpires that my wrist has actually been broken for the last 11 weeks. At the time, I was quite impressed with the clinic as I was in and out in 20mins but in hindsight, maybe they should be more thorough. I was the only person waiting in the urgent treatment center at the time so this can't be down to being pushed for time."
5430,"Orthopaedics - Everything was excellent - Not much to say other than everyone was friendly and professional, the treatment was fast and well managed. Thoroughly deserving of some good feedback. "
4083,"Children's & Adolescent Services - Ward 8 needs improvement. - I visited ward 8 at RPH after being transfered from A&E. Triage was fast and the staff in the observation bays are extremely attentive and knowledgeable. My child was admitted with breathing difficulties and was told we needed oxygen for them, we were kept on the observation ward initially to look at his oxygen stats prior to transfer, observations being done every hour and if the oxygen monitor bleeped staff were prompt to check on my child. Being transfered to the actual ward is where my care went rapidly downhill. I was told by staff on the triage was that once I got onto the ward staff would monitor my child administering oxygen as and when required. Once transfered to the ward in the middle of the night I was left with my child attached to the monitor, for it to bleep for over an hour before I had to press the buzzer for the staff nurse to come and check my child's observations. This was reoccurrence throughout the night where no staff came to the monitor bleeping, most nurses sat around the nurse station having a good laugh and joke and ignoring all monitors bleeping. I am not medically trained but felt I needed to be to make decisions around oxygen for my child's care due to the lack of support from the nurses on the ward. Support needs to be given rather than nurses expecting the parent to know whats best. "
1754,"Maternity services - Disorganised - I attended an appointment at antenatal with my wife due to reduced movements. 2 days of some monitoring turned up no issues and then my wife was called in for a scan and asked to attend in the morning at a specific time. We did this, scan was held around agreed time but it then took 5 hours of waiting for a doctor to review the results. Results which literally were fine and took less than 2 minutes to review. This is just pathetic organisation when you have on your wall operational excellence as one of your key aims. The clinic can't have a clue what this means. They could have told us looks fine go home we'll call if the doctor does find anything, or you know the doctor could have just looked at the results for 2 minutes and confirmed all fine, any number of opportunities for improving service but also actually reducing the burden of work on the hospital and having a pregnant woman sat on a bed for 5 hours. Poorly organised poorly managed. The staff were not friendly in the slightest and this is either, giving them the benefit of the doubt, them being overworked due to the poor organisation, or this is just how they think they should operate which again is a failure in leadership. The time spent dealing with this means my wife is literally terrified of giving birth at this hospital. I struggle to find the words to describe the complete shambolic setup that led to us being called in for an appointment at a specific time on the day, to lead to a 5 hour wait with no support or check up or any idea of wait time. Don't call us in if you can't handle the workload. I get there's an increased burden at the minute but that has little to do with what we saw. It's just poorly organised poorly managed operations leading to poor outcomes. "
2793,Don't know - wonderful staff - I've just been for a CT scan in the blue sky suite. The staff were just fantastic. They always are. I feel like I've known them ages. Wonderful people.
8140,All excellent
9274,"Please help @RCHTWeCare Relative admitted Weds & still haven't spoken to anyone directly caring for him. When answered told to ‚Äòcall back in x mins' but they're always busy. I get that Now no one picking up, for two days Please reply It's his birthday üòî"
814,"Despite everything going on with Covid-19, and considering it was 3:30am, I was greeted with smiles, kindness and compassion from the healthcare assistant covering a shift at reception to the Drand nurse who treated me. I wasnt made to feel a burden even though I was there for a silly reason having cut my head! It was great to see people smiling in such a challenging time."
7167,"I was seen by a nurse, Desiree, who is excellent. Great care and personal approach to a patient. Parking is a nightmare and patients should be warned."
3168,"Great dissappointment - My GP referred me to see a physiotherapist four times over five years. Out of four physiotherapists only one turned out to be helpful and productive. I am so grateful to this wonderful man who cared and supported me! I spend my time coming to Mary Potter Center struggling to arrange time off work. I come because I am in pain and need help. However, it is unfortunately almost always just a waste of time. They haven't got a clue. I can find better advice on You tube."
6644,"Ear, Nose & Throat - Impossible parking - I got to the hospital and started looking for a disabled parking space. Instead of having disabled parking all in one area. They are dotted all over the place. For it being a hospital are there enough disabled parking bays. After giving up on trying this, I joined the queue for the public parking. All being told it took 43 minutes to find a car parking space for a 12 minute appointment. I then had to pay 3.00 for this. The hospital staff were great no problems at all. Why build a hospital and not provide enough parking.... There should of been a multi storey parking system built to go along with this so called up to date hospital "
8022,"Rebecca (name) pre assessment was brilliant. I was in shock, sleep deprived, food deprived and very distressed. She was understanding and despite being under time pressures herself allowed me to talk and was helpful."
5392,"Thank you - I have recently had an operation actioned by staff on ENT and would like to thank the Surgeon, ENT staff and people like the anaesthetic consultant and staff for their kindness and expertise. I have had numerous tests during lockdown and was pleased to have surgery at this time, even though there are many more pressing things happening. Could I suggest it would be helpful for those waiting for surgery to be able to see a clock, just to know how time is passing."

I can't take it anymore the stress the NHS have caused me...

7045,"The Urgent Treatment Centre at Pontefract is a massive joke. My boyfriend had an infected ingrowing toe nail and has visited the UTC around 3/4 in the last two months. His toe has not healed fully yet and all they are doing is throwing antibiotics at him.. Also, the wait times are laughable, telling him that it will only be an hour, when in reality over an hour and a half later, he is still waiting. This is the second time in these two months where I have had to wait for over ...an hour and a half for him. one of the receptionists suggested that I drive home and pick him up when he is finished but I don't have that fortune as I am a learner driver who can only drive WITH HIM IN THE CAR.. Absolute joke!! "
6390,"Thank you Ward 8b - I was admitted to Gloucester royal on Thursday and was taken up to ward 8b the respiratory ward as I was having major trouble with my oxygen levels and my breathing, I was very emotional and nervous when I first went in as if never been to hospital before. When I got there everyone was so lovely and helpful making me feel as at home as I could be while I was there! I had a cannula put in, was started on a nebuliser and and steroids and anti biotics straight away! I was seen by one of the respiratory doctors the next morning and they explained more about my care and what they wanted before I got sent home. Our obs were taken all throughout the day and night and they were very strict on what we could and couldn't do which was definitely for the best even if it drove me mad not being able to walk about too much! I definitely did struggle in there with my anxiety but I think more because it was something I'd never have experienced before so didn't sleep too much while in there but that's not the worse thing. Really I don't have a bad thing to say about being in there at all, all of the nurses and everyone that was there to help were all absolutely amazing and helped in any way they could even if it was just sitting and talking to you calming you down! Thankyou so much to ward 8b and everyone that worked on it, I don't know where I'd have been without you all! üíï xxx"

7587,We had to take our 11 week old baby in to Dorchester hospital after speaking to one of the doctors on the phone. The doctor we seen was absolutely amazing and could not fault in the slightest.

7385,I had an out-patient surgery today NHS treatment is good but the administration is very tardy. I was given the wrong address for the hospital in the letter I received and was 45 minutes late. 8 miles away. #nhs #tardy #epsom #cobham #Surrey
6511,No 1 percentis not enough. Everyone who cared for me during my recent stays at both @NorthBristolNHS and @uhbwNHS were so utterly caring and professional they are worth so much more than this derisory figure. Let's treat them as well as they treated me
8809,I visited the hospital today with my 92 year old Aunt who has a gynaecologist issue. She was treated with such kindness and dignity during what can only be discerned as a private issue and shown such care. Everyone there has just been great. Thank you all so much for making a difficult situation much easier to deal with.
1523,"Fantastic paramedic team - A big thank you to the paramedics who picked me up from my flat (literally, as I'd fallen over and thought I might have fractured my hip) and took me to Kingston A&E on 23 May. They were both fantastic. Very reassuring, kind and professional. I can't thank them enough, or praise them too highly. Thank you both so much. "
5344,"I was rushed into the Countess of Chester cardo vascular unit last month. I needed stents to be put into my arteries leading to my bowel. The procedure was completed and I'm now on the road to recovery, thanks to the doctors and nurses. May I also say that ALL the staff on ward 53 were absolutely fantastic with me. Everyone of them has a great bedside manner and ALL of them were really helpful in anyway possible to help me get better. I must also give a mention to Emily, she is a class act. As a person and a nurse. She came into my little room, where I was recovering and took the time to sit down and talk to me, when I was feeling a bit depressed. She made me feel a lot better after a good chinwag. She's a ray of sunshine.... to me anyway. Thanks again folks."

7010,"I could go on about my experiences at Springfield hospital, crocus ward, 1994, could probably write a whole book about it, haven't got much more to say than the other service users It's when you're sick and ill, in an inviroment like Springfield, crocus ward, that you start to realise that nobody cares, but that's part of the healing process because you think, nobody cares, so what, but im going to dam well care about myself, even if they can't, and when that notion finally dawns on you, that's when you truly start to get better, having the kind of, you don't like me, but i sure do like myself attitude"

5275,"I arrived early for my blood test and interview with a Dr. about my ongoing chemo. My blood were taken in less than five minutes by a nurse who didnt even leave a mark in my arm, then after check in was seen within another five minutes by a very caring female Dr. I then left feeling happy with my visit before my actual appointment time, only regret is I could not talk to the Dr. for longer but they are always busy."

565,"Oncology - Medical - Very Poor Service - I am writing on behalf of a friend who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in early September, based on scans. It took four weeks for a biopsy to be performed and four weeks later she is still waiting for an 'urgent appointment' with the consultant. She has had no treatment for the cancer. In desperation this morning, she tried from 8:15 to 11:30 to phone the department. Eventually her call was answered by an obnoxious receptionist. In my friend's word 'I've not got anywhere - never had that before'. Surely this lack of medical treatment is unacceptable and the response from your staff is inappropriate. What are you going to do about it? "
5446,The staff were very pleasant and helpful and hospital very clean
7376,Maternity services - Great Breastfeeding class! - I attended a fantastic interactive yet informative breastfeeding class at north Middlesex hospital. I had by chance seen it advertised in the maternity unit whilst being in early stages of my labour. I met the friendly infant feeding coordinator and explained my situation and asked if there was any space on the course. The feeding coordinator was very friendly and approachable and allowed me to be added on as a late addition. Although I am a second time mother I found the class extremely interesting and informative. We were even given some amazing literature surrounding breastfeeding which came in handy when I delivered my baby 6 hours after the course. I would definitely recommend this class to everyone not just first time mothers not only did it equip me with the right knowledge but it also informed me of many support networks available to me. 5 stars all round! 
291,But weird being on the other side of the curtain but thank you to all those on ward 3 @BucksHealthcare who looked after my daughter for the past 4 days #NHS
1444,"Never go to the emergency department of princes Royal hospital. My daughter is suffering from stomachs pain of the right side with fever for ten days now. We go and come back, and they take a blood test and urine. They don't even do the ultrasound of the area she is having pain. Today we are back to princes royal, referred by our GP. They again took a blood test and did not even check the area she is complaining about. I am still sitting there with unprofessional consultants who don't even know the pain a child is suffering. The diagnose is a bowel problem ( can you believe it ). They told us to go back home. Don't know where to go with my daughter who has fever with no diagnosis."
6537,"Massive thanks to the Picc Line team, Becks, Julie and Debs, professional caring and kind, thanks girls, ya superstars x. Also thanks to the PIU team for there help many times, lovely staff.

5379,Move if you can - rubbish - Practice has been getting worse up to the point where I would say do not register with them. Appointments rare 2 week wait for phone triage even if obvious need to be seen. Further 2 weeks to be seen if deemed allowed. Doctors rude and ever changing. Receptionists rude but do feel a bit sorry for them having to implement doctors rules. We all know covid has affected things but other businesses and NHS are dealing with it now. Hospital face to face appts are going ahead and other practices coping. Please sort yourselves out before the place is deserted. 
3164,"Diagnostic Imaging - Friendly Team - I had to have an MRI scan I am extremely claustrophobic and was worried about having it done, I was given some tablets to relax me, but the MRI team were very friendly and took the time to help me relax and calm me down, so I would like to Thank them for helping me get through it "

3418,"Very rude receptions. We went there for a blood test today, as there is a booking issue, the doctors on the second floor patiently explained to us, and told us to book another appointment elsewhere, so we checked the booking website at the corridor downstairs. The reception saw us and drove us out with a rude manner, saying that we should get out. I know we might not be allowed to stay at the corridor, but we stayed there for no more than one minute, is it a crime or something that deserves to be treated rudely? "

8258,"Gynaecology - Fantastic staff and services EPU - I was referred to Early Pregnancy Unit at the end of December as I was experiencing problems with my 9 week pregnancy. After an early scan my husband and I were told the worst. I had miscarried and we were devastated. My scan was dealt with and handled by professional, kind, understanding and patient staff who were just lovely. They really looked after me and my husband and answered every question with knowledge and sensitivity. I returned for surgery at the beginning of January and again the staff on the ward and at theatre were great. Nothing was too much trouble and again I was treated with respect, dignity, patience and understanding. I was given all relevant information and am surprised and pleased that a memorial service will be held for my baby and all other babies should I want to attend. I understand that the staff literally deal with this situation numerous times a day, every day, but their care and work ethic makes you feel like you are the first and they are genuinely sorry for your loss. I cannot praise this service enough and would recommend it to any lady that may need to use them. Thank you"

2786,"Intensive Care - Expert and compassionate care - I was admitted to the A&E department just before Christmas. From there I went to the ITU, to HDU to ward 20RE for 3 weeks and in EVERY department I was given excellent medical treatment and was treated with such kindness and patience at a time when I could do nothing for myself. It didn't matter how busy everyone was, they were always there for me with a smile and cheerful comment. At a very low and scary time of my life you all helped me get through it and I cannot thank you enough. "

7023,"Cardiology - Great pre and post cardiac service - I was diagnosed with heart disease around the end of 2019 and had a quadruple by pass ( at Harefield Hospital) in September 2020. The pre -surgery help at Harefield was terrific, and the post operative care and advice from St Peters / Ashford Hospital was outstanding. Such an operation can leave one feeling anxious and vulnerable, but your team were attentive, encouraging, supportive and patient enough to answer all my questions, and gave great advice and guidance. I am eternally grateful! "

1529,"At first, was my 1st app in that clinic and in my eyes (even is pandemic) should be face to face - I thought it would be that way (from my letter which I was checking on various occasions) and I had find out day before, is actually going to be tel consultation. The other thing is, I felt not listen to, on what I am saying, doctor seemed to not read my notes before making the phonecall and felt like he want to get off as soon as possible - doctors have access to medical records from gp as well as letter referring me should say the reason for it. Last thing, which I was upset about, to compare me to 70-8"

At this time the receptionist could have told me they didn't do teeth. When I was finally seen the person said they didn't do teeth and couldn't help me with antibiotics, no examination was given although I've had my two jabs. Date 11/06/21 Mrs Anita M Hird"

They all were kind, considerate and professional, Im pleased to say my test were all negative. Many thanks to all ."
9837,"Excellent care - I didn't want to go to A&E just for an injured knee, but a call to the Walk-in Centre persuaded me to do so, as I might have needed an X-Ray. When I arrived at Reception, there was a sign indicating a potential wait of four hours. I was there for two, which was fine, particularly as there was a clear system in place which seemed to work smoothly. All the staff I spoke to were patient, kind and considerate. I felt very well-cared for and I remain very grateful. I am sure this was true of others who visited that morning, as the atmosphere in the waiting area was calm and friendly. Thank you all so much."

5680,"Haematology - Ridiculous bureaucracy - I went for 4 different blood tests at the Blood Taking unit, my midwife had sadly neglected to put my date of birth on one of the four forms and at 33 weeks pregnant I was made to walk for 25 mins across (& back) the hospital site to get the antenatal clinic to add my DOB to the one form. My DOB was on all 3 of the other forms and my NHS number was present on the form they rejected. I had just had 4 vials of blood taken and at 33 weeks pregnant I was suffering from severe Braxton Hicks contractions by the time I successfully arrived back at the Blood Taking Unit, having had a receptionist in the ante natal unit date the form. I also incurred unnecessary parking charges due to the 25 minute walk I had to undertake around the hospital and what should have been a five minute appointment took me 45 minutes and considerable physical discomfort. They could simply have added my DOB to the one form it was absent from, having in their possession three other correctly dated forms and my correct NHS number. I feel this was incredibly heavy handed and inconsiderate of them and that they completely failed to take into account my physical difficulties and what they were asking of a heavily pregnant patient."
5229,Huge thanks to @ChelwestFT for transferring me to the Holiday Inn Heathrow so I can self isolate safely away from other key workers. I have been looked after so well after only being here for a couple of hours! Thank you for looking after your staff! #COVID19 #StayHomeSaveLives
1727,"Don't know - Excellent experience - I wanted to leave some feedback about a recent experience. I visited A and E on Sunday 7th November with a suspected blood clot. The wait time was reasonable, the care and attention given to me and my symptoms by the stafd were excellent. I felt every precaution was taken and my symptoms were not dismissed. I was promptly rerfferd to the Dvt clinic and had an appointment made at 9:15am the next morning. The DvT clinic was a smooth and professional operation. Things were clearly explained to me and I was thoroughly examined and had a scan to check out my arm. No clots were found and I felt at ease that I had been taken care of. Please pass on my thanks to both departments for helping me during this time. "

5152,"stroke treatment, or lack of! - I had symptoms of a stroke and took myself to Louth urgent care centre, along with my husband, who has Alzheimers. I told the receptionist my symptoms and was told to take a seat. I waited nearly 2 hours to be seen by a doctor, who then said I was showing stroke symptoms and told me very sharply, to ring one of my children to take me to Grimsby A & E. I was shocked by this attitude, I had gone there for help, thinking I was having a stroke and they didn't want to know? ? I have 2 children, one lives miles away and one has a small child, and I still had my husband to think of. I thought strokes were time critical? I wasn't offered a phone, luckily I had my mobile and rang my daughter who took me to Grimsby with a letter from that doctor. I waited another hour to be seen, and was then told Louth shouldn't have sent me to Grimsby, they should have sent me straight to Scunthorpe in an ambulance. I then waited another 45 minutes for an available ambulance to take me Scunthorpe on blue lights. I was thoroughly disgusted by this doctor's attitude, and by the service they offered, I almost went home. So much for all the stroke adverts and the NHS service. terrible service Louth! ! ! My symptoms started at 2pm, I went to Louth at 5pm and I wasn't actually treated with anything at all until 1 am the next morning at Scunthorpe, so too late for the fast treatment you are supposed to get for a stroke"
2107,"Phlebotomy services - Roof falling in - 27 November 2019. Was visiting the outpatients at Charing Cross Hospital. Was clear something was wrong when I got there ‚Äì part of the roof was falling in. Not exactly what you want to see, but the staff were coping wonderfully, keeping patients away from the danger area and directing them towards the check in area. Didn't get the senior nurse's name, but she was marshalling staff and reassuring patients. Great work. Service was fine ‚Äì usual wait but excellent staff. Why do our fantastic NHS doctors and nurses have to cope with underinvestment that means the hospital's literally falling down around their ears? Bet they can find the money to pay for all the managers though."
9075,I went to St Mary's after I'd had my little boy for help with breastfeeding and I can't thank them enough for the care we received.

1006,Professional and reassuring staff - From being referred by my doctor to the endoscopy unit at the heartland hospital to the procedures being done at the Solihull hospital was so professional and reassuring from all the staff. all my apprehension was unfounded ( well until the result from the polyps are returned ) but the professionalism was second to none. I would like to thank the doctors and nurses for all their help and guidance.

1397,"Excellent virtual service - I just completed a series of 10 intensive CBT sessions conducted virtually with an excellent practitioner. These virtual sessions were extremely convenient as it meant that I did not have to travel for 45-60 minutes each way during the workday to get to appointments, taking much of the stress out of the whole experiences, and also making it much easier to adhere to my appointments, complete 'homework' and think more deeply about the tools, experiences and learning from each of the sessions. The quality of interaction with the therapist was just as good as my previous face-to-face experiences, but with the added conveniences as described, I would highly recommend this virtual mode of delivery, particularly for those who are already pressed for time due to full-time work and parental commitments. "

After the procedure, the doctor explained clearly what would be the next course of action. I left feeling very reassured."

I called back after speaking to my GP to get some more help and the receptionist was so rude, terrible attitude, not interested in listening, they need to learn how to speak to people correctly. They are there to help people and yet I felt I was in the wrong for questioning the change in guidelines and what extra support was available as I had been told by my GP to call and ask for. But instead of understanding and a willingness to help, I got a mouth full of attitude. absolutely shocking for a service that is supposed to be caring "

8781,"The staff were like Love Island. The staff put up their own cameras to monitor the patients then use them to thinly veil their agendas. For example one nurse will walk into view in an extremely tight dress, make a few poses and then you'll hear some not very subtle comments from the next cubibcle or two up. Care was non-existent. When the head nurse had to pop out for a bit, she assured me the two nurses she left in charge were looking out for me. At least one of them was from the other camp, the other one I didn't see at all. I even heard the deputy tell her staff to leave those two till last indicating myself and another. When I tried to discharge myself I was physically locked inside the building, and Security was instructed to not allow anybody with my name out."

974,"My 87 year old mum was admitted to the Manor following a nasty fall. It took 24 hours for a drink of water and nearly 2 days for a bed pan. They showed no compassion, no care, and no people skills and hardly anyone can communicate or converse in a way that you can understand. Nobody there was willing to administer basic needs and often she was left in a degrading situation which no human being should ever be put through. Worst of all, on leaving, she had no discharge note, no doctor sign off and no pain killers. Do yourself and your loved ones a favour and go somewhere else."

3054,Helpful staff even though they where all at the end of there shift.And probably tired. They where also dealing with a tricky patient. Top service they should be on more money.

3882,Wow! On Thursday we welcomed our baby boy to the world with the amazing support and care from the team on the birthing centre. This was our third baby to be born on the centre and all three were delivered in the same birthing pool! The facilities are so good. You have your own room with en-suite and kitchenette so your partner can make refreshments as and when. The staff make you feel at ease and give you lots of support and reassurance. Nothing is too much trouble. A special thank you to our midwives Rebecca and Brogan for delivering Oakley-J x
1721,Awesome Staff.. Dedicated and very caring
3070,"Compared to other private health care I have received from other hospitals, the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth's level of service has been extremely poor! I would actually rate no stars if I could! Avoid this place! "
6370,"Appointment was on time and very thorough, I didn't feel we missed out on anything which could have been done face to face. My only criticism is the technology used for the appointment wasn't very user friendly, I couldn't access it on my laptop but I've never had problems with Zoom or Teams for example."
1866,"Worst maternity unit in the World I had my child there and the Nurses and Midwives are horrible, they don't care about you or the Baby...."
2504,"Unclear if could enter building or if had to wait for member of staff. Notices everywhere, confusing and didnt make things clear. Reception office in darkness . When someone did emerge seemed very vague about orthopaedic clinic. Left waiting beyond appointment time. Doctor arrived late. Had to ask Nurse where waiting area was for clinic. Overall impression was pretty disorganised."
2908,very kind and attentive

1507,"General Medicine - No quality of care and misdiagnosed - Having spent a week in agony and been told by my GP to go to A and E for tests. I arrived at 12:30PM and after having X-rays, blood and urine tests and a tummy examination. The doctor came into the waiting room and told me and everyone else that the results were- I am constipated!! It was now 11-30PM and I was so fed up at this point, I knew they were wrong but after that diagnosis, just embarrassing and everyone was staring at me. They never even looked at my back and the symptoms that were there. Well 2 days later I was back at my GP diagnosed with shingles. What a waste of NHS X-rays etc‚Ä¶ if only they looked at my back in the first place."
7769,"Appt was on time, everyone was very friendly and helpful, talked me through each step and ensured my well-being at all times."
8831,Worst experience ever. Only one doctor in urgent care who is taking care from cardiac patients to pediatric to broken bone. 8 hours wait for cardiac patients. Its horrible and a nightmare. Anyone know any other urgent care hospital near harrow please comment. Had to come back without seeing a doctor after 4 hours wait

5673,"NHS frontline staff doing a brill job. But you're not the only ones keeping the country going, and we need our sleep. Please stop quietly driving miles, then blasting your sirens just outside our neighbours house, on dead quiet streets when there's no traffic or people around - they work for the NHS too."
5672,"12 hours ambulance waiting time and been waiting for almost 5 hours with child less then 5 years old to be treated. It's a joke. But then what can you expect from NHS when they were already short staffed, not enough funded and now gotta deal with millions from around the world who managed to get in country last 2-3 years."
8834,Just had first vaccine dose in my arm @UHSFT hub. Great efficiency thanks to all involved.
7417,Why do 17 year olds get forgotten about?? - I went to the gp with my son as he has Adhd and Asc and with A levels coming up wanted to go back on his meds to help him concentrate. I left enough time for the referral to PRISM to go through but not heard a word from them needless to say I'm having to take an already anxious young man back to the doctors because we've been let down again by this service! Camh don't want him and adult mental health wont help so what can you do?? Past experiences with my daughter at 17 taking and od of paracetamol and sitting at the hospital bedside while Camh and adult both say they don't want her makes me worry here we go again it's just unfair and not on that this vulnerable age group have to suffer this way!!! 
3207,It was an over phone appointment. I felt it was very helpful and a very nice lady putting me at ease
8004,Cataract - The staff at Grantham hospital day ward looked after me really well on the day of my operation I couldn't praise them enough 
1934,"The staff were all very efficient, only problem experienced was trying to park my car. I arrived 45 minutes early, I gave up after 20 minutes and had to drive onto Park Barn estate and find somewhere with no yellow lines and do a very fast walk for 15 minutes, arriving at the main entrance 10 minutes early! Very stressful start to my appointment."
3869,Top notch service. Kind caring professional . Cant fault the team at all.
8214,"Accident and emergency services - Kind and caring staff - My mum and I took my dad to A&E as he had chest pains, and has previously had a heart attack. The security guard on the door was so kind to us, and my dad as he had to go in on his own - giving us regular (socially distanced) updates about how he was doing and whether the nurses / doctors had seen him yet. He was so lovely and empathetic towards us and our situation. I'm confident he is this kind towards others admitted to a&e / wards where their families can't see them. I'm grateful for your act of kindness, and I'm mad with myself I didn't get his name to mention! Thank you!! We attended A&E on 09/08/20 in the afternoon. "
4754,"Send your family to another hospital if possible... Had really unpleasant experience, nobody wanted to help just passed about.."
5057,"5. All arrangements went smoothly. Charming consultant. But no service could be provided as examination not available. I had an hours drive and this could have been dealt with on the phone instead | You were unable to deliver a service due to your COVID procedures. The visit was therefore pointless. However, I was very well received"

8031,"General Surgery - 7 days of hell on a ward - Can i start with i received great care . From all the nursing staff all the doctors brilliant. Love them all for the work they did on me . Now as for the ward . Bangkok Hilton dose not come close. Were to start . The average age on my ward was 75 to 85 + . I am 64 . I was in for 7 days . I had no sleep for 5 of them . The was a man with Alzheimer's. Who would stats at night shouting for 3 to 5 hours. On the second night i was beginning for a sleeping tablet and was refused . I pulled a chair on to the landing as i could take no more I got moved to another ward next day to be followed by the man with Alzheimer's . No tvs the windows just a concern wall in frount of them . The bit of music came from a 4 inch clock radio no news papers no visitors cut off from the world in that ward not good . All the men ware warring bags . The ward toilets stunk . No internet. No visitors. No news papers no tv. But the was a big clock so we could watch ever minute pass . Christmas day Christmas dinner. To a man it was sent back as not one of us could face it . We all needed sleep . I got two nights sleeping tablets. First night i woke up at 3 am to find security on the ward to try and stop the man with Alzheimer's . One night he had the nurse's in a head lock . I had depression when i went in . Thank god cos if i had not i would have had it when i left . I sat on the bed one night in tears begging to go home, the night staff got me though that . I was going to sign my self out . But my wife stopped me . The was one old man there he was terrified ever night. So for my first long stay in hospital i would not recommend . And if i spent more time on this a could do 3 more pages . But i have reported it to my mental heath worker . As for the food . I was never asked what i would like untill the 5 day . "

1414,Amazing podiatry service - **** Amazing****is the word I use to describe the staff that work in the podiatry department.. very chatty and polite they put the patient at ease from the minute we walked in the door.. would definitely recommend to others and they deserve a 5* review thankyou
3322,Don't know - The pits of the NHS. - I visited the A+E department yesterday (31/08/2021). The staff were extremely rude and discourteous. The NHS charter says patients should be treat with respect and dignity I doubt if they even know the meaning of those words.
4552,Stayed in there for 2 nights and 3 days. The service in the reception (especially the checking out which took me almost the whole day) is extremely slow however the meals were super good and the rooms were very comfy. Also the staff was friendly which made me happy during my stay.
8157,"Excellent service - My husband attended out of hours with swollen leg. Within 2 hours he had been seen, given precautionary medication for possible DVT and a follow up appointment in clinic the following day. This was followed by a scan and review. Thank you to all staff involved.All so professional and caring.this service exceeded any expectations . Staff should all be commended on a high quality, professional and reassuring service. "

4804,"My ankle - I had a new one put in although it wasn't nice to have done everyone treated me so well, it had to be done"
5046,Ringing Royal Surrey this morning and getting through to the ward I was put on hold over 5 mins waiting is absolutely wrong as all we want is some answers and to see how our loved one is who has been in your hospital now for nearly 3 weeks and were not allowed to visit!!! We wanted to send our best wishes and our love so they know that we are thinking of them and just to give them some lifting spirits but noone answering is so upsetting üò°
4131,"They looked after me very well after being sent to a&e, all the staff were very kind and helped me"
4634,"If you need a same day emergency appointment, you must show up early. Be outside no later than 7.45 and wait for the doors to open, otherwise you may well not get an appointment. The student dentists and assistants are fantastic, I can't praise them highly enough. The demands put on them are huge, but they do excellent work."
6135,"The nursing staff in the wards are great but once you are discharged and have to wait for the urology department to get in contact to treat a tumour forget it, it's been almost two week and still not been contacted and when you call them you can't get hold of anyone. Worst hospital experience ever."
9929,"My Dad is 80 years old and has dementia. My Dad is called Keith and lives in Cossington, Leicestershire. I would just like to say a HUGE thank you to every paramedic that has been out to him. Im so sorry that he calls you so many times. Thank you so much for being so caring and understanding. The service you have provided has been fantastic. You have gone above and beyond. Thank you"
2850,The doctors and nurses are doing a fantastic job. However on more than one occasion when I've been asked to gel my hands the sanitiser has been empty and I've been told not to worry about which I don't think is acceptable also I have been unable to get receipts for parking as the roll had run out of paper and therefore had to walk a far distance to the security office to get one. It's just not good enough. We pay our taxes for this and on top of this they want to privatise the NHS which 8s all about profit and not the care of the patients
33,I cannot speak too highly of the Candover Clinic. The treatment I received was absolutely top class and all the team members were incredible. Personable and professional and lovely guys and all so kind and helpful.
1636,"A big THANK YOU. I sprained my wrist on Sunday afternoon (1/11/20). I had to take pain killers to be able to sleep that night. So I went to Worthing Hospital A&E the next morning. The method of reporting my problem on a tablet was straight forward (with 2 kind receptionists available if there was any problem). The Triage was quick and I was soon seen by Geoffrey of ETU (if I have remembered the correct department). He sent me for an X-ray. There was no hairline crack, just a bruise between the ulna and the radius. Geoffrey set me up with a wrist strap / brace, which has been comfortable and reassuring. Thank you for your quick efficient treatment 5 stars."

8048,Busy in a&e. But most people are so helpful
1530,"Ear, Nose & Throat - Cancellation - After waiting for an appointment for our 4 yo son for longer than desired, c.3 months, we received a phone call the day before our appointment to cancel it because the Consultant is on annual leave. Surely this could have been foreseen more than with one day's notice. Work schedules and childcare arrangements had been altered and ultimately our poorly boy is still no nearer to receiving the treatment on the NHS he desperately needs. GPs can prescribe antibiotics, but this is not solving the problem and he is building resistance. Very sad at this experience and hope more notice will be provided for others in the future for this department at Bedford. We wait to hear when we will receive another appointment with the hope, if not belief, that it won't be another 3 months of living with daily pain. "
9589,"Due to our local hospital closing down i was told I had to travel 30 minutes away to be seen regarding problems with my foot, when I turned up I felt a bit guilty as I know how much pressure the NHS has been under.. all the staff were absolutely amazing despite being under pressure they were all very bubbly and willing to help. I cannot thank them enough for all there hard work and care for people. X"
4129,Excellent care and kindness.

Please pass on to all the team my heartfelt thanks.

There I was seen by a specialist doctor, sent to a consultation with a physio there and then, and ready to go home at 11am. What incredibly great service!

226,Accident and emergency services - Communication and understanding - My husband is Deaf - signs British sign language. The security lady was so helpful and determined to make sure that my husband had access and communication - she made sure I was admitted into the restricted area too. Thank you v much for your humanity and awareness. The nurse on the door wasn't Deaf aware (but security sorted it). Thank you to the caring and efficient male nurse who saw my husband at the final station in A&E and the X-Ray people - thank you for your Deaf awareness re how are deaf ppl supposed to see through masks? And thank you to the kind and efficient gentlemen in the waiting area of the x-ray department. We may have waited 3 long hours but your Deaf awareness and professionalism was appreciated.

1046,"Don't know - visiting facilities - Due to my own surgery and isolation periods, I have now very recently managed to see my wife who is in D3 QA hospital, I applied for a further visit but was told that the number of visitors was at a maximum of 10 visitors for one day for the ward, now I know that there is more than 10 patients in D3 so that implies that many patients do not receive any visitors at all if the visitors do not book early enough. I ask has anybody taken into account the mental stress that this can cause on top of their medical condition, there surely must be a more acceptable method to ensure safety for all. I would also say I was surprised at the number of staff primarily in reception areas who are NOT behind screens in the wards, who are not wearing a mask."
6177,"Absolute Dier, St Catherine's ward was a shambles. No one knows anything, they tell you one thing dissappear for 2hours+ a time. Don't answer the emergency buzzers. It needs a HOLE new Staff input on that ward. We've decided we won't be having our baby here. So disappointed"

5048,"I thought the staff I dealt with (I am afraid I can only recall one name among the several people, first name Martian), most thoughtful in their words and behaviour at setting me at ease and explaining things at each stage from arrival. The final steps to being put under sedation, the same: it seemed a happy, well organised, professional experience if I can put it that way."

There is ample parking space and wheelchair accessible, one can notice the vaccination centre directions and there are security and staff outside the site for guidance.

3805,"Emergency Abdominal Surgery - Amazing - My GP referred me to the surgical assessment unit after having awful stomach pain, and I had my appendix removed later that day. Every single member of staff I came across were LOVELY - made me feel completely at ease (this was my first time in hospital), they explained everything to me, kept me calm when I was in theatre, and just looked after me so well. Yes they were busy, but this didn't affect the quality of their care at all. I stayed overnight and was checked on frequently - I also had two student doctors when I first arrived and they were also great. Thank you!! "

1781,It was a follow up telephone appointment - but the nurse listened and advised onMy current situation and medication
2477,"I was incredibly impressed at my experience in St George's A&E earlier this week. The wait was not too long and I felt that I was taken very seriously. The doctor who saw me, Flora Casey (sp.) was intelligent, professional but at the same time respectful and caring taking time to listen and making sure she did the necessary tests and referral for me. She is a real asset to the hospital and the whole of the NHS."
9817,I have to say the experience of your service I give you a 1. Everything was done so thoroughly and quickly so no complaints at all. You are all doing a wonderful job.
611,"Diagnosis pathway - I moved to Crewe in May 2019. My son was 6 years old at the time (he's now 7, nearly 8) my family and I came from Telford, where he was on a waiting list for a diagnosis process for ADHD which wasn't going to proceed for a long long time due to staffing issues. Once we moved to Crewe, I had a referral in place for him immediately. I waited a couple of months and finally got his initial appointment expedited due to the nature and severity of his symptoms. He was seen in August 2019 after his appointment was expedited. His current school and myself, then waited a month before we got the infamous 'Connor's questionnaire', which were promptly filled in by both of us. Time ticked on and I hadn't heard anything going into January. I phoned the paediatric team, who told me they acknowledged the forms in December and that the next step on my son's diagnosis pathway would be about 6 months from then taking it to about June time. Sometime in February before Coronavirus lockdown came about, I asked the team to please expedite his appointment again (after all, there was obviously a reason for his first one to be so urgent). I was told I'd need a GP to write to them to confirm reasons. First GP I asked refused to get involved. I then asked another who sent correspondence regarding my concerns. I heard nothing, so contacted the team again who told me they couldn't even see any correspondence and that if they thought his appointment should be expedited again from what the doctor wrote, then they would have done. I waited yet again, then lockdown occurred. I contacted them again only to be told they were now only dealing with already medicated patients!! I asked another GP to write to them and I STILL haven't heard anything!!!!!! He should have been seen by now and I know that Coronavirus / Covid-19 has turned the whole world upside down, but to hear nothing at all is EXTREMELY irritating. In the meantime, I have found out, they only want to go down the ASD diagnosis route and not ADHD too which is absurd! Nobody in Telford would even acknowledge he had ASD traits and only wanted to diagnose ADHD. I'm mum and I know he struggles with both disorders. The outcome for him, was to medicate to hopefully help control his impulsivity etc. which is of major concern. There seems to be nowhere I can turn to to be able to help him. PALS haven't even replied to me. To get no response at all from anywhere or anyone is very worrying and my family and I feel really let down."
3301,"What an absolute brilliant place. Every member of staff. (Bar none) is an absolute legend. If you're a cleaner or a surgeon, you are all brilliant in my eyes. God bless you all."

5521,Accident and emergency services - Amazing hospital - This was my first experience of Kingston Hospital & it was a very positive one.

9772,"I would change nothing, staff were very helpful and informative."
8889,Terrible parking
9876,"Awful place. I would never be a patient here again. Given that patients have brain injuries, etc, they do not treat people with respect and can be very rude. Have never enjoyed being a patient here."
9559,"Lovely welcome the church was quaint, much history, the gardens are worth a look round even saw a Red legged partridge with her babies, cafe is clean and tidy but for some reason shuts between 12:30-14-30? Nice location we walked from the city via the river and colleges, about a mile well worth it"
8570,"So we had a bit of a scare this afternoon and following a call to the maternity triarge unit we had to go in, they thought I might be in early labour. Thankfully I'm not but I have been diagnosed with pelvic girdle pain! The joys. Many thanks @sthknhs Maternity unit & midwives."

As a eighty year old male at every stage I was treated with the utmost care and attention that also includes all the Porters who delivered me to each department, they all have my sincere thanks."
6656,Urgent care centre - Lovely helpful nurse - Visited as couldn't get hold of GP in 3 days of trying. Cannot fault how helpful the nurse was in not just diagnosing and managing my pain but also her empathy of my situation. Think her name was Tricia.
2289,Working in my car at the #NorthernGeneral @SheffieldHosp waiting for my son to have physio appointment. Struggling to focus as marvelling at how efficient the grounds staff are clearing roads and car parks of snow. They're working non-stop and keeping it safe for us. Thank you üôåüèª

9663,"Waiting room locked, instead, patients had to wait in crowded corridor!"
2427,Seen straight away | No
8598,"Fantastic medical facilities and staff; I've nothing but praise. But, and it's a big but, whoever designed the outdoor car parking system needs sectioning - he's clearly mad!! ANPR reads your registration plate as you drive in and you enter your reg number at the very few OUTDOOR ticket machines and pay by cash or card, and then the exit barriers raise as you approach them. Great theory, but wait till it's raining / snowing / blowing a winter wonderland wind and you'll soon realise that the very common 20 deep queues at the unsheltered machines are so commonplace that you'll need treatment for exposure!! And the number of machines is totally inadequate for rush hours. And the complexity of the machines is clearly meant to bamboozle even the most intellectual of us! Good luck! "

4892,"Children's & Adolescent Services - Ward 25 Care - After going straight to A&E with my 12 month old, we were transferred straight to ward 25 and the staff that took care of us were lovely and so reassuring. The doctors were so lovely with my little boy and answered any questions I had and were telling me what they thought and what they were checking for and always made me feel comfortable. They didn't talk down to me or dismiss any concerns I had, it reassured me my son was in good hands. The nurses were equally as lovely. They were so gentle and careful and nothing was too much trouble. My questions were answered and anything I needed or any sudden worries were dealt with straight away, it was such a comfort at such a scary time for me. The nurse that looked after us on Monday and Tuesday even went as far as to pop her head round the door before she left to check we were ok and say goodnight. The catering staff were nice enough to ask if we wanted lunch and dinner bringing before they heated it up as they could see my son was sleeping a lot, and always said to let them know when I thought he was ready. I do need to mention the cleaning staff too as they were so quiet and careful while he was sleeping but also took the time to have a chat with me which meant a lot as my husband could not visit which left me quite lonely at such a distressing time. I hope my thanks and gratitude is passed on to ward 25 as I greatly appreciate everything they did while my little boy was under their care for 4 days. They were so good with my son and kept me well informed of what they thought, the observations they were taking and reassuring me. Thank you! "
9536,I have just arrived home after having an operation on a brain aneurism. What an absolutely amazing hospital!!! All the staff and departments were so professional and caring.....thy explained everything that was going to happen to me. My stay afterwards on H7 was absolutely amazing......I have never had that level of care anywhere I've been in before. Thank you Salford Royal and particularly H7.
7900,Don't know - Constantly cancelling appointments - My baby daughter has been waiting for her appointment and it's constantly being rescheduled. The staff are rude and unhelpful and don't seem to be bothered about helping anyone. 
5467,"Kim at urgent care could not be anymore polite or helpful. After bringing my 11 year old daughter to see a doctor at urgent care, my GP surgery (buckshaw village) was utterly incompetent in following up test results and getting my daughter the right course of treatment needed. Kim had to ring buckshaw village surgery direct to get them to issue the correct prescription. Disgraceful!!! Thank you Kim, for your kindness and support."

7272,"2. The Nurse was excelllent. I would have given a 1, but I queued outside for two hours. It was extremely cold and I was absolutely frozen by the time I saw the nurse. Also, there was an elderly gentleman who joined the queue with a walking stick and was struggling. I had to ask for a chair for him. Also, As I was driving out, I noticed a lady who joined the queue, who was struggling with her breathing and I believe that the hospital staff should be a little more observant of the people in the queue."
7068,General Medicine - Shocking lack of care - My mother was admitted to ward E1 and the level of care and attention was appalling to say the least. Ward was understaffed and quality of care resulted in a safeguarding notification being raised through social services and hospital team. Only saving factor is that the escalation to a senior manager resulted in change of ward where the level of care was significantly improved. The treatment of my mother on the ward by certain members of staff was substantially below what would be reasonably expected by a care professional and this needs to be addressed by the hospital management team who have been made aware of the concerns and facts.
6947,Efficient nice people doing great jobs well done
4875,"17 million people a year attend A&E when they could had gone to a walk-in centre or their GP. I had to attend A&E as I had an open fracture. Upon attending I was in a queue of two additional people. The first gentleman I heard him say he has an ulcer that appeared on his back in the last few hours. The lady in front of me attended because she had a papercut on her finger. The receptionist literally asked if she had come for a free plaster! Throughout the evening other people attended A&E including one women who had twisted her ankle. It isn't for me to judge what you think an emergency is, but the fact the lady with the papercut left after an hour is very telling. It is also hilarious that the same time-wasters are the ones constantly asking when they'll be seen whilst the people waiting with genuine and urgent medical concerns are waiting without any fuss. Such as the man with a broken forearm. Having had my joint put back in the right place, I suggested that I should leave and come back to have it stitched up the next day. The nurse stated that I was one of the ones that needed to stay. I hadn't realised the extent of the issue and that I required surgery! This was a Thursday evening. Doctors open from around 8:00am and if you ring them you'll be seen the same day as I have been no matter when I've rang my doctor throughout the last 18 months! There are also out of hour surgeries available as several years ago I attended one at 19:30 in the evening as I couldn't make a day appointment. There are also several weekend surgeries available. A&E isn't and shouldn't be treated as a doctors surgery alternative. There are already 17 million people per year wasting the A&E time and 180 A&E departments. 250 people per day per A&E needlessly and I saw around 30 of these people at North Manchester General Hospital! In my personal opinion, everyone should be triaged and if they're deemed to be wasting time (such as for a papercut) be sent home and no further treatment provided. Think! Before you ring an ambulance or attend A&E for non emergency incidents. You're wasting their time, your time and alot of money! "

9198,"Boyfriend is in there for the first time. He doesn't always get to talk to his doctor during the week and he's not informed of when he's going to see him, this adds to his anxiety. Staff at the reception not always answer the phone you have to try several times. One of them even hung up on me while I was trying to leave my phone number I rang back and there were no apologies found it very rude. I gave two stars as hygiene is not too bad and a couple of nurses have been helpful on a couple of occasions."

9195,"I am really sorry but as much as most of the employees are probably fine, and do know their job i believe that NHS should be focusing more on the way how some of their employees speak to patients and visitors. Last two experiences absolutely shocking. First from physio department second at maternity department. I understand you have processes to follow but there is a way you explain this to others! we pay our taxes for this services so we are still your customers so please try to get some customer service under your skin in future!

I checked him in and went to wait in the car with his brother (my husband) who I can't leave alone for long, telling my brother in law to ring me when he was done. I asked the really nice receptionist to keep an eye on my brother in law. When he was finished, about an hour later, he rang me and I went to pick him up from the lobby. He said the staff were amazing and so kind and helpful, walking him between the rooms and bringing him out to the lobby afterwards so he could get a signal to ring me. The most amazing part of this for me? It was actually easy to park. "

3707,"It was well signposted so easy to find the department I needed, easy to check myself in for my appointment and I was seen promptly."
481,"Gynaecology - Second to None - My patient journey began during gestation. Scans picked up a cyst- the radiology staff were very very professional. I was reassured by the consultant it would be dealt with after delivery. Not long after giving birth to a healthy bouncy baby with the best midwife ever (I've had 2 previous babies) my appointment dates came through for a follow up outpatient appointment. Yesterday I attended the Day Surgery Unit at 12noon and was discharged at 1700hrs. My patient experience from the receptionist to the nursing assistant to the staff nurses, the anaesthetic surgeon and the consultant surgeon was nothing short of compassion, kindness, patient centred, safe and professional. The clinical areas were also spotlessly clean and everything was well sign posted. Even car parking zones was available for 2 hours for drop off and picks. I walked into theatre with a staff member and everyone instantly made me feel at ease with their instructions and where to go and what was happening. It was just as we see in the movies; the lights the green uniforms, the machines, the trolley bed all the staff fussing about the patient. My recovery was swift no headaches or nausea apart from some tenderness which is to be expected. The surgeon came and saw me after I was made the best cuppa and buttered toast by the nursing team. Discussion about what was found and ongoing investigations was relayed to me and I felt the surgeon was so very patient with my never ending questions. I am humbled to have received my first keyhole surgery under such God gifted gifted talented hands. It was truly a win win situation as England won the World Cup football semi finals after 40 years last night! I feel blessed to be alive and living in this wonderful country receiving world class care some can only dream about. I've lived in 4 but England I have to say is second to none. Long live the NHS and long live the Queen."

9628,Urgent care centre - Friendly staff - Went in with a finger injury. All staff were polite and friendly. Triaged quickly and seem after about an hour. Finger patched up neatly and helpful management advice given. The water dispenser was broken but as patients were moving in and out quite quickly it wasn't really a problem. 
5293,"Accident and emergency services - Nice Surprise - Had to attend A & E following a fall and was really surprised to be seen, x-rayed and diagnosed with hairline fracture of my wrist all within an hour.

7603,"Breast cancer services - Wonderful service at the Jasmine Centre - I was urgently referred and seen in 10 days. My appointment was on time and all aspects ran like clockwork. From being welcomed at reception to the doctor and all other staff (scanners, biopsy takers etc) I was treated with respect and kindness. I was lucky enough to not need further treatment following my tests but I would have had complete confidence in this centre to provide anything else that would have been necessary. Thank you, what a great job you're doing! "

2616,"Don't know - Wonderful fantastic lady at Covid 19 testing centre - Absolutely wonderful service beyond expectations and very very gratefully received, the lady concerned will know exactly who I am as I turned up on my mobility scooter, but please send my greatest thanks to her. As for your organisation more generally I have had to attend several times over the last couple of years and am very very pleased with the service and quality of service at each and every occasion apart from once."
7572,"Don't know - Fertility Clinic - After many years of trying to conceive me and my husband decided IVF was the only hope of us having a family. After months and months of waiting for an appointment we were mucked about from the start. Firstly, my husband (even though being from a Commonwealth country and had lived in the UK for 15 years as a citizen) didn't have the right documents, then he did have the right documents, then we waited another few months for an appointment, at which we were told we were eligible for 3 rounds of ivf. When we finally did manage to see a Dr everything actually went smoothly. We confirmed if we were eligible for 3 rounds as I was nearly 40 and told yes. I also double checked with the lady who took our introduction class just to make sure so we proceeded with confidence and hope. I was lucky enough to have two good quality fertilised eggs but ufortunately I ended up having a miscarriage. I was promptly phoned by a nurse who promised a follow up appointment as this is what they apparently provide to all thier patients. I was then told that I wasn't eligible for any more rounds. When I questioned this the nurse said she'd enquire and shortly after I was sent a rather curt email from the funding team telling me that because of my age I wouldn't be able to have any more rounds. So why is this when all throughout I was told I was. It has now been 3 months and I still haven't received a follow up appointment, but this isn't new to me considering our previous experience with them. I spoke to my Dr who is looking into this and enlightened me that they change the eligibility rules all the time so she wasn't surprised they went back on their word. I've found the administration behind this clinic is very poor and definitely lacking. The Drs have been brilliant but my advice to anyone thinking about attending this clinic is to phone them and not email regardless of what they tell you. It is not quicker. Be prepared to constantly repeat yourself to any admin staff and do this over the phone otherwise you'll never hear back. You maybe waiting on the phone listening to their you are now number 6 in the queue. To help save time you can email... Blah blah... but it's better than not hearing at all! "
8542,"Intrapartum care (care to women in labour) - Incredible care - I was so impressed by the amazing care our family received from the labour ward at Kings. I had a difficult birth, but the calmness and professionalism of the midwives and the surgical team was incredible. Even when I had to have an emergency cesarean, in the ten minutes we had to prepare, my midwife looked at my birth plan and went though my wishes (I'd written one should I end up having a cesarean) with me and made sure I was feeling reassured and had autonomy. The entire process felt very mother centered, even though I had to have interventions. Excellent care throughout. Kings is a shining example of how all labour wards should be run and I feel very lucky to have given birth here. "
7399,"General Surgery - Friendly, compassionate and kind staff - I spent my day in the surgical triage unit and the staff were incredibly supportive and compassionate, ensuring that I was in no pain and took time out of their busy day to listen to me when I asked if I could talk to someone about feelings aside from the reason I was in the unit for. They listened, offered heartfelt advice and even got me lunch. I felt very supported and listened to! "

8718,"I have huge respect for all the staff at the hospital so it really makes me almost feel guilty to say but I feel like the nurse who triaged me the first time was extremely disinterested in what I was saying. She was fumbling around in her pockets and looking in them whilst I was explaining my concerns. As an anxious person and someone who this was very new to it wasnÔøΩt the best thing. The nurse who triaged me when I returned at first was also quite brash with me. 111 had advised me to not take any further pain medication and the nurse made me feel quite silly for coming straight to A&E like she thought I should have done something else. I explained my health anxiety and she said ÔøΩwhy???ÔøΩ Almost with a smirk on her face and told me at the very worst I have a blood clot. This panicked me hugely and the doctor totally reassured me that my symptoms were not of the ones of a blood clot. | I think the nurses who triaged could have had more empathy and been a little bit more caring. I understand our nurses work long shifts but I donÔøΩt believe this is an excuse to be borderline rude to patients, especially patients who are quite clearly very anxious already."

7982,"Awful paediatric care - My son has been admitted to Willow ward 4 times in as many months with infections that have developed into sepsis. Each time something important has been missed by the medical staff which has resulted in my son having to be re-admitted. Other than a handful of helpful nurses, the treatment of both patient and parents has been very poor."

2651,"The care I received when I was seen by ANP was excellent but I found the process frustrating. I had already spoken to clinician via 111 and was referred for X-ray. Therefore not sure why I had to go through whole triage process again to be told eventually I needed an X-ray! Also there was no indication of waiting time so my son waited in car park for me rather than going home and picking me uplater.However, I do particularly want to thank all the staff who were working on Easter Sunday ."
5448,"I don't know how I would have coped without @OFFICIALWMAS yesterday. The care, compassion & patience shown by John Taylor & his partner (sorry, don't remember her name) was extraordinary, especially atm. A bar of Cadbury's Caramel was the very least I could offer. Thank you."

My daughter Sorcha said how really kind you all were with her. I couldn't agree more!! No one wants to see their child hurt or injured, to witness it is bad enough. Please accept my sincere gratefulness for your time, patience, kindness and advice to re-assure us.... Thank you, you are all amazing. Sheila and Sorcha xxü•∞ü•∞"
7220,Diagnostic Imaging - No knowledge of Poly Myositis - I came in for an MRI scan. I am grateful to the NHS and the heroes working but....l I have been diagnosed with Poly Myositis and needed images on both legs. My condition is rare but the Radiographer seemed to have no idea of how it affects patients. No strength in the core muscles top of legs hips or top of arms. She eventually picked my legs up onto the bed after I asked for help but in doing so I fell backwards which caused my neck to kick back without support. I felt vulnerable as she told me to ‚Äúmove down‚Äù on the bed again something difficult with no strength. She gave me headphones but did not communicate with me during the scan until the end telling me I had 6 minutes left and I was doing well. As I was extremely nervous which she was told she gave no reassurance to me and I was crying as I laid there. I had suffered a panic attack previously in the scanner. After the ‚Äúordeal‚Äù was finished she did not attempt to assist me to get off the bed again until I asked for help and from that..l I was told the entrance was ‚Äúover there‚Äù and as I could not put my shoes on by myself there was no attempt to help me. No one supported me up the corridor back to the waiting room or checked that I was safe as I was shaking and upset. The fact of having this scan is traumatic enough but surely staff should be aware of certain conditions that may need them to help more sympathetically and support patients. Also to put patients more at ease? I am grateful for this lady working during the pandemic and have utmost praise for all NHS staff. I realise it could be skeleton staff in the department but I am just feeding back that certain conditions need more assistance rather than the unsympathetic person I encountered. If I return I will make my needs clearer and if I am unhappy I won't be returning to Southmead and will choose a different hospital. I will also be feeding back to my consultant in Rheumatology. It has upset and hurt me (when the website states I would be SUPPORTED during the scan.) A pleasant lady took details as I first went in but she was not around as I came out? Maybe it was not the Radiographer's job description to give more care but in the absence of a nurse she could have assisted me asked if I was ok as I staggered out with my shoes untied and could have fallen. 
5500,A year ago at this very moment I was having my shattered shoulder repaired by the divine Mr H and his team at Royal Blackburn Hospital. Thank you to him and the staff at @ELHT_NHS fracture clinic for their amazing after care. #SaveOurNHS #NHSNotforSale #GeneralElection2019
9629,Support for a vulnerable individual - I work for a charity that supports individuals who are homeless or who are vulnerably housed. My client receives support from the Rushcliffe Mental Health Team (RMHT). I needed supporting evidence for a social security benefit appeal. The information I needed was complex and the response would certainly be time-consuming. I received a timely response from RMHT given the nature of the enquiry. Staff at RMHT realised that the information I required was urgent and hand delivered correspondence such that I could submit the evidence in time. Staff were careful to keep me updated with events and took time out of an undoubtedly busy day to ensure that I received the relevant correspondence. An obviously incorrect decision has been overturned without the need for my client to attend an appeal hearing because RMHT took a a serious interest in the issue and in our client's best interests.
2621,Coming out of hospital with correct equipment.

I was so so happy that the team supported me to have a natural delivery and avoid section which was what I had aimed for. We are doing well back at home and adjusting to life as a new family. You are all wonderfully brave, amazing people. What would we do without the NHS? Thank you from the bottom of our hearts üíï Best wishes Vickie, Piers Lidbury and Little Max üíô"
7695,"Endoscopy - I was referred for an endoscopy procedure. I was contacted by the colorectal nurse very soon after the referral and a date for my procedure was agreed. I was also contacted by a member of the endoscopy team. After some confusion over whether I was having a colonoscopy or a sigmoidoscopy I attended Grantham last week for the latter. The procedure was straightforward, with the staff putting me at my ease. Staff were very apologetic that I had to wait for 90 minutes, in a gown, in the corridor for my procedure. They told me that senior management had changed the system on that day, which meant patients couldn't wait in the more comfortable recovery area, but had to be held in the corridor. Other than that the experience was a positive one."

9557,"Rheumatology - Upsetting - Revert to the 1970s. Nurses lovely helpful. Seems the dr may have been late and it reflected in an appt where i was patronised. Questions too quick to answer. Dr in a rush wasnt listening. Dr was concerned about another aspect of my health that was already under control. I guess the easy option. Did not do what i was sent for. Came away being told i should expect my condition at my age, im not that old! i need a good nights sleep to cure another long term health condition and frankly when i see my dr i already know it will be met with surprise! Even the dwp have treated me with more respect. I could never advise anyone to go near this dept. Did i remember to say about the lecture i got for no knowing the full title of one of the department staff id seen a couple of years back? That seemed to matter more than anything. I will never forget the drs name ever. I didnt need to be there. The dr already had a pile of leaflets on the desk so the outcome had already been decided before i got there! If the dr had asked me i could have given him a more factually detailed account of my other condition he professed to not be an expert in but lectured me anyway and it was all very much disputed theory. But the dr friend had a theory. And tried to trick me on clinic names. Why does a dr in rhuematology ignore his own field and why you have been sent to him and try to tell you about one you obviously know more about than he does? Always the easyway out and always the sign of someone trying to save time at the expense of others. People should know they could face the same awful appointment i did. I am never going back there ive more dignity that i was afforded."

Despite the understandable difficult circumstances because of Coronavirus, they all went above and beyond to ensure that I could be with my baby while we both recovered. They were caring, understanding and always willing to support me. My start to motherhood could have been very different if it wasn't for the staff and I will be forever grateful for the quality of care and treatment I received. "

When you finally get through no appointments available for the Nurse for 2 weeks! Get a message saying surgery doors are now open, go to try and book an appointment with the nurse to be told they don't take appointments it's all done online (confusion) The receptionist had a bad attitude and come across as if she didn't want to be there, she was rude and dismissive. Once she had finished saying what she had to say she lent back in her chair crossed her arms and just looked at me. Think it's time i look for another doctors surgery and it's time the old cottage staff Adjust their attitudes and have more respect! "
3705,Every one was really friendly and kind I was a bit nervous but there put me at ease xx
5675,
7592,Very friendly and informative visit. Thanks
2837,Got treated as priority which was reassuring
9090,Very friendly and caring staff. Also great to have M&S shop and Costa in hospital.
6770,Can not fault the staff or the hospital. The only criticism I have is lack of contact between doctors and patient. But overall I was treated with the utmost care.
904,"I had my first Covid vaccination today courtesy of @NNUH. It was so well organised, with good directions, good parking and good social distancing. The staff were kind, warm and professional. #ThankYouNHS"
8726,"I very much like this hospital, it saved my children when he was sick of cancer, he later died thoughSAD So maybe not so good hospital? But overall like experience: D have a nice eavening! (Picture is son)"
9441,"Its used be a great hospital that looks after their patients, but now its a joke. Apart from a nice looking clean hospital"
3146,"Excellent care, prompt treatment"
1344,The treatment was done thoroughly and professionally. Nothing the staff could have done better as far as Im concerned. I was in and out quicker than I expected and the results were clearly explained to me. Ive had a little pain/discomfort since but was given helpful information leaflets which are helpful in that regard. Overall very satisfied.
9411,"Helpful and friendly, sympathetic."
2475,Clinical Treatment
4316,Staff where very friendly but considering appointment was during covid I dont think training staff and extra staff should be in every room ... every department I went to had at least 2 people and the ultrasound at one stage 5! 
9241,"My cancer journey treatment - I had a cancer diagnosis, a total surprise. There followed a year of treatment including chemotherapy and surgery. It was a faultless time, even more amazing during the totally challenging times that the NHS is going through. Everything from the clinical expertise to the kindness and compassion was without fault. I had treatment at the Bostonian Ward at Pilgrim Hospital Boston, Grantham Chemotherapy Suite and also Nottingham Hospitals. It is also important to recognise the contribution of all teams, from the kitchen, hygiene, X Ray, pathology, so many to mention. My grateful thanks regardless of the outcome as everyone was battling with me on my behalf."
8760,"1 the physio was very kind and helpful | The physio was very thorough, kind and helpful"
2985,Well organised and safe.
6532,Waiting Time
5626,Waiting times were very long
9450,In @WestSuffolkNHS up since 5 am staff really are so kind üò∑ reading a üìô and just waiting for procedure. üò∑ https://t.co / B2d5NT0wA2
7364,"General Surgery - Excellent service - Visited with damaged toe in a great deal of pain. Was triaged almost straight away, X-rayed and treated by very knowledgeable, committed and friendly staff. "
3195,"Good service, friendly! Thanks"
5435,Orthopaedics - Poor Nursing Care - H4 Ward ....Nursing Care was just awful the staff were dismissive of both patient and relatives concerns.They congregated round the Nursing Station and were unhelpful and rude when asked for anything.My partner is a a retired nurse I am too my mother and aunt also and we despair of these staff members. 
5865,Let crying in pain asking for pain relief after operation would not give pain relief will be going further when I get out
6679,Practice quality - Some members are very patient and understanding and the quality of care is good. However the criteria for attending is too strict and doesn't make it as easy to attend as you may think by reading about the service. This can be very hard for some people who find travelling difficult. Some staff are very accommodating others are not welcoming and seem not to care so much as others. 
7419,Everything happened efficiently and on time.
1967,Prompt and explains well
5839,Easy
5717,"Had to have procedure today at @CUH_NHS Addenbrookes; I can't thank everyone on the team there enough: all so kind, compassionate, efficient and caring. Thank you. #nhs #NHSMillion #CUH_NHS #proudofNHS"
2595,Despite being refused therapy for being too unwell; being told I would benefit from antipsychotics; and being told I definitely had clinical need I was discharged to GP with no rationale and was not even informed. @TEWV told @CareQualityComm That I'd failed to meet threshold.
777,Clinical Treatment
2031,"What a pleasant and peaceful experience it was to visit this hospital on September 3rd. The moment I walked in I was greeted by a very helpful receptionist who told me exactly where to go for Radiology.I was greeted by the two radiographers who instantly put me at ease before I had an MRI scan.. My experience was excellent. Thanks to the very kind, friendly and strictly professional staff."
4640,Never seem to be any spaces and some very tight corners to get round was bad enough when free but even more annoying when you are now being charged again for parking
7939,Thank you to all @LancsHospitals staff at RPH A&E Dept who took such great care of my Dad last night. #Thankful #NHS ‚ù§Ô∏è
7808,committed staff striving for excellence
8039,"This tremendous small hospital never ceases to amaze me and it did so again this SUNDAY morning when I attended for a scheduled appointment at 0815 in the Audiology Clinic. Despite it being mid-weekend and almost the middle of the night, Tracey, the convivial, highly professional and expert senior Audiologist, treated me to an extremely thorough examination and assessment. It really did feel like Christmas because I left with a brand new hearing aid and a supply of fresh batteries. On the way home, it was the first time I have heard the tell-tale 'clicking' of the direction indicators in my car for years! My sincere thanks to you, Tracey and your excellent staff for looking after us all so very well! Aren't we fortunate to have the WGH on our doorstep? "
6070,Everyone helpful kind & patient. Making a stay in hospital acceptable
4939,"Been waiting months just to be seen by a dermatologist here and still haven't been seen months later, absolute waste of time, about time you're seen and spent 6 years doing their tests and stuff to actually get started on a treatment is insane, but of course due to 'covid' it seems number of people going to them with acne and stuff has increased...whatever...wont have me outside clapping for the clowns thats for sure."
6677,"Helpful parking available outside the venesection clinic, easy access, and superb care from the nurse."
6720,"Overwhelmed with the fantastic service - I have needed to visit the hospital twice now, through appointments. On both occasions I was treated with care. There is nothing negative that I could possibly say about any of the NHS members of staff. I had first class treatment."
3928,
2403,My physio was so understanding and fantastic. It could have been improved if my initial appointment was face to face not phone.
6668,everyone was very professional and pleasant
4673,
6698,"Cardiology - Safe, supportive and friendly - Prior to arrival I had a couple of calls about my admission and Covid test etc. Very friendly helpful people. I was admitted to Cardiology ward early on 19th Nov. On arrival at the hospital I felt safe and reassured by Covid protection in place. Made my way to 3rd floor where after checking in, I was fairly quickly taken to the ward and prepared for surgery. All staff were extremely friendly, helpful, reassuring and most importantly professional. I was taken to theatre where the surgeon took the time to get all technicians to introduce themselves. Again, I felt completely safe, a bit nervous, but reassured and generally happy. On return to the ward again staff were fantastic and really looked after me. One individual was really comforting and helpful to me, but appreciate names can't be given here, I was discharged around 18:00 with very clear guidance and information regarding what I needed to do and availability of aftercare. I have nothing but praise for Barts. Thank you for what you all do. "
5268,The wait in A / E 4.30 hours then another long wait after the Doc first saw me But the care by all the medical and ward staff brilliant xx
1959,"1 very good  Great communication from start to finish, made to feel at ease by friendly efficient staff"

5184,Clinical Treatment 
230,"Thank you so much for the amazing care we received yesterday in the emergency department for my daughter. We were seen and treated so quickly, in total we were there for just under 2 hours! All of the staff were so friendly, happy and smiling but I wanted to say a special thank you to (and apologises if I have their titles wrong) the doctor and nurse who applied the cast - I believe they were Kris and Zoe, they had my daughter smiling and laughing throughout, it made the whole process so much easier. She especially loved the addition of glitter!! Thank you very much."
4704,Well run | no
3847,On time and quick and painless.
5917,Ok
4404,Not the best - You have some genuine nice staff that are obviously there coz they care but others are just there coz they have to work . Left doesn't know what rights doing and we never got to look round with our family member and have never seen a welcome pack or anything. I have never been told or given information of who is charge of our family members care no point of contact and staff don't communicate there's not enough intense one to one therapy's or anyone to talk to and service users are just left in there rooms constantly.all round disgraceful 
1856,"While waits in A&E can be lengthy that is because they triage effectively, The most serious cases get seen to quickly. Many of the other visitors spend the wait grumbling, not realising that they are part of the problem and should instead be at a walk in centre. Anyway the medical staff have only ever been great and accommodating and I'm extremely glad we have this service in West Brom."
2170,"Absolutely appalling; my 89 year old grandma spent 2 days on a trolley inA&E, no one called us and no one answered the phone when we called A&E (I personally spent 2 weeks in TROH earlier this year and their policy then was staff contacted family daily with a patient, which was some comfort) now we were left wondering if our loved one was dead or alive. On day 3 she was transferred to AMU which we found out by a fluke misdial and yet again AMU didn't call the family, nor answer the phone. Finally on day 4 she was transferred to G1 and we were told she was allowed 1 visitor at set times each day yet now on day 6 G1 are saying the visits will be stopping completely as ward managers do not want to have visitors; not due to any legitimate reason around covid but just beause they just don't want them; it shouldn't be allowed- covid is now the byword for poor care and basically as an excuse to stop visitors. I have researched and lots of hospitals are offering limited visiting so why the stance here???? I wonder if they would feel the same if their loved one was being left alone and scare at 89"
9355,"Massive thanks to the staff at Leicester General Hospital. I rang about my Dad who has dementia and had fallen over at his care home, breaking a hip. Not seen him since lockdown. The staff sorted a video call out for us. Made my day. #NHSThankYou"
5045,"Kirsty Forward was so helpful and reassuring, she was able to put my mind at ease and my 16 year old daughter at ease. She is a credit to your department."
4528,"My Wife was admitted to this hospital and was refused to contact me, and they refused to let me have details of the ward she was on, they say that it was her wishes and they must respect them,,, Really i went to her by telephone via there own system and we spoke about this and she had asked to speak to me, and asked for me to be contacted but during that call we was cut off by a member of staff who listens to the calls,,, I have tried to contact her via the site manager several times and nothing not even a call back from them."
1759,"Maternity services - Zero compassion whatsoever - I had to visit the early pregnancy assessment unit due to worries that I was having a miscarriage, I was told at first that I didn't meet the criteria to be seen until I had bled what they deemed excessive (even though I was losing a lot of blood and tissue) when I was finally told I could be seen, I was told my partner would be able to attend with me due to the circumstances we were facing. When we arrived he was told to wait outside for over an hour and wasn't even given a chair to sit on. I was taken alone to be told that I was suffering a miscarriage and had to tell my partner myself what was happening. The nurse that told me had no compassion whatsoever and was blunt about the whole situation. I was told I would receive a phone call with the results of my blood test within 2 days. I still haven't been told. The overall experience was horrific and not just because of the information we received. I am disgusted with how I have been treated and hope no-one else gets the same treatment I received."
7735,"3rd chemo today. Exhausted and now preparing for the side effects!!! My thanks to the #NHS particularly Eden day unit staff at #WexhamParkHosp. Your professional, caring, understanding attitude is making this nightmare manageable. God bless you all."
7291,"Great hospital, loads of free parking and was seen very quickly.. Prefer using this hospital rather than PAH."
7128,treated well 
3147,Excellent service and really friendly staff would recommend this hospital I only about every 12 months. The coffee shop is great too
5652,Staff are doing a good job.
601,Service was relatively quick and reassuring
1182,"Thank you so much to the staff at Grangewood I rang at 5:30 desperate for some help, the receptionist was lovely, I got a call from Kylie within half an hour and by 7pm I had the medication I needed Thank you all so much for your help! "
3209,"Discussed at switch board, multiple attempts to call to speak to ward. Phone not answered unless late at night. Calls diverted to wrong hospital."
9395,"Don't know - Visitors - I appreciate everything that is being done to keep patients and staff safe and the hospital is doing a great job. At present I am only able to book one visiting slot for one hour which I understand. However, when I visited my partner yesterday there was another slot still available immediately after my slot had ended. I asked the nurse if I could take that slot as well but I was told No. To me this makes no sense as I am already there and it is basically a wasted slot that I could have used to be with my partner who has just had major surgery. More time with my partner would have helped him tremendously. "
8792,Excellent treatment
9372,had pneumonia pretty bad but the nurses and doctors did a realy good job
9938,Staff Attitude
932,
223,the care i have received has been first class especially from the nurses and HCAs them have been kind all the way through my treatment.
4994,"I am disgusted and appalled with Consultant Mr Iacovou's abhorrent attitude. Transport was arranged for the appointment with Mr I, the transport arrived at exactly the same time, I was due to be at the appointment- despite my many communications to hospital transport (currently waiting response from E-Zec re formal complaint) at the time. Unfortunately by the time I would have arrived at the hospital- I was advised the consultant would have already left and as this was a physical examination appointment- little point to have it over the phone. A letter ensued from Dr I as follows: Arrangements were made for transport to the hospital for her to attend. However Mrs ****** decided not to come to the clinic and refused to leave home when transport arrived. I have not arranged any more appointments. The best news for me as a patient for 2021 - thank goodness no future appointments have been made- I would not want to be accused of rejecting any assistance or to be denied treatment by a doctor. This review warranted a minus- sadly one is the highest available. Any media wish to contact me -please do."
7052,"There are a few reasons:1. First it was really difficult to get an appointment as this clinic only runs on Mondays morning. I work on that day and I had to take a day off, even though I cant really afford it as I am only paid when I work. 2. Parking is a nightmare. It takes a really long time before you can get a space. 3. The Dr. was an hour late on my appointment time. I know that his time is precious but my is as well. It is very disrespectful the way people are treated. Every time I had an appointment I had to wait that long, even longer sometimes. It is all right for him to take his time but it"
7959,I was kept waiting for over an hour for my appointment
7472,After spending a full night at this hospital and leaving at 6.30 in the morning. We had to return the following day as they have done an error. We have the privilege of sitting so far for 6 hours to be told there are a further 16 in front. We were told over two hours previously there were 20. If we were customers visiting a business you would not return. We have no choice to wait as they have messed up and have to correct what they have done. They don't care what do ever. Very disappointed
809,No Medical college No Tertiary care Hospital No Engineering University No Nursing College No Institute for Business Studies No PMDC / CPSP Centre No research Institute No Internet Facility No Constitution....why......???? #Education4GilgitBaltistan
5093,The staff were friendly enough... but the doctor. The doctor... He completely ignored 40+ years of medical history and everything i had to say. I felt like I was sitting across from a flat earther or anti-vaxxer. Just kept on his personal script and pushing minor issues while ignoring proven life threatening ones.

2363,"Came in for my knee operation yesterday and cannot speak more highly of the staff in here on cedar ward they have been absolutely amazing, so kind and careing and nothing is to much for them, by far the best hospital I've ever been to, so thank you to the morning and night staff"
3347,"'(Lamiroir was taken directly to the hospital. Ema ran around, barking orders, making phone calls. Trucy just clung to my arm and cried... And me, I was still in shock. Two bodies in two days is two too many.)'"
3357,Many thanks to Rachel and all the wonderful staff on Cedar Ward. My mum was 80 on Sunday and they arranged cakes and a lovely birthday cake üéÇ with candles for her. Mum was totally overwhelmed as we were by the kindness shown. Mum has been very poorly and the care and love shown to her has been second to none. We were able to see her in the garden with masks on and it meant so much to us all. Thank you so much for everything. You are all angelsüòá
2117,"Don't know - Radiology - I attended for a barium swallow requested by the ENT Department. Everyone I met yesterday was fantastic, from the young man who asked if I needed any help as he walked along the corridor to every single member of staff I met in the radiology department. They were all kind, friendly, helpful, and supportive. The process was explained in detail and I was given plenty of time to ask questions. Not a particularly pleasant procedure, but the staff made the overall experience a great one. Thank you all! "
7018,Allergy services in hospital - Friendly staff - The doctor who saw me was friendly and the nurse who took my blood was very friendly and supportive. The waiting time was also quite short
1486,Waiting 3+ hours still not seen what a joke no wonder people pull our NHS down why pay staff for nothing people sick of waiting and walking out never seen anything like it

6254,"Vascular surgery - Practice ok - I have had appointment of Consultant in the month of March. After the scan I was expecting a written report to GP in 3 weeks or so, but no report is received by GP yet. This is delaying the further treatment required to be taken. "
5267,"I was aware of the Queens dire reputation before visiting however, the A&E department truely is third world in every respect."
913,"Efficient, kind, thorough, caring. I saw a clinician Joel who stayed with me and helped me back to my car lift. As the X-ray showed no bone damage he and the orthopaedic clinician Mart (h) a talked round the problem, suggested higher short term pain relief, said they would refer it to the orthopaedic panel in the morning and hoped my own surgeon would follow it up by telephone."

2890,"I have been in a fire and cannot breathe, have been having trouble breathing since it happened. My head hurts and I feel like im going to faint. I have been waiting here for two hours to get a lung scan, but have gotten absolutely no where. It is 1 am in the morning. Theres a kid puking and clearly very ill, also have been waiting with me for 2 hours. We are in the emergency section. This is a joke."

4723,"Respiratory Medicine - Excellent ward Care - I was admitted with pneumonia in December via the a and e department. The care of the respiratory care unit and ward 12 was excellent. Most staff were attentive and caring but rather busy at times! My only criticism would be staff making up respiratory rates rather than taking the time to assess it properly, i had a breathing rate of 20 allday everyday! The whole of gledhow wing is tired and oudated, why they are spending money at the LGI when this wing is awful and not fit for purpose is beyond me! A and e was dirty and staff spent alot of time on the computers and not with patients! "

6896,"Blood test booking system - Obtained blood tests form from my GP on 20/05/2021 tried to make booking on telephone recorded message on same day, 2 options hang on (54th in queue) or register for text call back facility. Chose the latter today its 27/5 heard nothing tried to call again. First call 14 mins number 45 in Queue got to 8 and cut off!! Immediately tried again this time number 62 in queue put phone down and tried the text message still waiting. Just tried again number 58 in queue persevered and after 20 mins answer and managed to book appointment. An appalling service! I'm able enough to do this but I'm afraid this service is failing many and needs serious attention. I am not the only one complaining."

5985,Incorrect paper work given to the person dealing with me. She did not introduce herself or her status. For all I know she could have been unqualified to make the assessment so not exactly confident about the outcome. However she was polite and caring. Very perturbed seeing staff congregating by the office door with no regard for social distancing especially as they were not wearing masks. These interactions appeared to be social rather than business. I would expect our NHS to set an example at this difficult and worrying time. My other surprise was when I arrived and given a mask was then asked to pull i

1559,"The staff were very welcoming. They ensured I understood why I was there, and took time to answer my questions. I felt safe and relaxed given the circumstances. After my procedure the results were explained clearly to me, in a manner I understood and with patience. I know I asked some questions twice. The department I visited was absolutely spotless. I was not worried about catching Covid in the hospital but the precautions taken again made me feel safe.I am not very good at articulating my thoughts on paper and hope these comments express my opinions."
2719,"a very big thank you to everyone who treated me - a very big thank you to everyone who treated and helped me after 4 fractures in ankle I am writing to thank all the staff at Tameside hospital after fracturing my ankle in four places last October {2019) Firstly the ambulancemen made me feel at ease and with whom I had a lovely chat all the way to hospital. Taken to a and e where my very special male nurse helped, along with gas and air, to cope while the foot was straightened. I was taken to ward overnight and then taken to theatre. Again everyone who prepared me for theatre were so reassuring - Theatre nurse, doctor and anaesthetists. My operation took five hours. I cannot thank my surgeon enough. He is my hero. I will always be grateful for everything he did. I am at the moment in the over 70s group of people who are at risk of catching coronavirus Still okay at moment. Fingers crossed. Thank you to everyone who helped me a few months ago and also thank you to everyone working in the NHS today and over the next weeks [Unsure about 'Team work'] "
7278,I was totally impressed with how quickly I was seen as soon as I arrived in fracture clinic. My cast was removed straight away and I was kindly wheeled round to x-ray by the plaster technician to save time waiting for a Porter which I thought was excellent service. I then didnt have to wait long for a Porter to wheel me back to the clinic and only had to wait a short time to see the surgeon. Throughout my time at the hospital all the staff were extremely courteous and helpful and overall a very pleasant experience.

There is a big difference here, and also the treatment I needed involved moving my leg, which wasnt done for the whole wait time which ultimately has made my injury a lot worse and now I need time off work which I cannot afford to do!

I was told by the nurse I needed to be seen face to face and have a scan which would take place in September 2020. No appointment came. I finally got through to someone end of September and was told I would receive an appointment ASAP. Appointment came for November but would be over the phone. The surgeon was the most obnoxious, awful person I have ever dealt with at this hospital. I have been told by him that I cannot be seen face to face or have my scan for another 8 weeks...Covid vaccine permitting (his words, not mine). What an absolute disgrace! Thought the NHS was still open? "

8631,"Having spent 36 hours on the stroke ward at the PRU I cannot praise the staff highly enough. They were all highly professional and very caring, everyone bar none. No one likes to be in hospital but the care and attention I got was excellent. Thank you all doctors, nurses etc."
3948,"I have currently been having dental problems for 12m. I am not currently registered with a dentist but have been getting emergency dental appointments through 111. My previous appointment (in February), I was referred to the dental hospital for an urgent tooth removal. They ‚Äúlost‚Äù the first referral so I was then referred again as urgent. I have been chasing this for a number a weeks now and I'm not ever able to get through to speak to someone. I have to leave messages and it states they aim to respond within 48hrs. Weeks later and numerous calls and still nothing, so I guess they have lost my referral AGAIN!! I can't just show up and line up hoping to be seen as I have a baby, so it won't be fair on my baby to drag him on a bus all the way where there is a chance I won't be seen!!! "

2086,"Covid 19 risk in A & E - I attended A & E in mid October. I was surprised to find that no checks were made as I entered the foyer (so different to other health facilities I have visited recently) and hand sanitiser was not pointed out to me. On entering the waiting room I was shocked that no hand sanitiser was available, one patient was wearing his mask underneath his nose and one around his neck, yet neither were challenged. I was in the department for over two hours and during this time none of the chairs were sanitised. Once all socially distanced chairs were occupied, additional patients had to stand thereby compromising the distancing. I was also shocked that no paper towel was available for the examination couches. I was told it had ‚Äòrun out'. It would seem that this is not an isolated event. A friend also visited A & E some weeks ago and had the same experience. It is appalling that the supermarkets pay more attention to keeping us safe from covid 19 than this department."

3983,Accident and emergency services - Very Long Wait - I understand the doctors and nurses are under tremendous pressure due to covid but it took me upto 2 and half hours to just have a word with my local GP in the morning. Once they picked up they said a doctor will call in the afternoon. The doctor called and advised prescriptions and said to go to A&E urgently. I went to King George Hospital A&E at 6 in the evening. I had to wait in queue standing for about 2 hours till a nurse saw me and gave me a red card and told me to go to A&E reception. At the reception they said it will take a minimum of 2 hours to meet a nurse and there after 7 hours to meet a doctor. I waited to meet the nurse and explained my suitation and told him that I am in pain and can't wait for so long. I requested him to give me a nebuliser and take my blood test and let me go home to return next day. But he said its my wish. I waited for 2 hours more till I got a nebuliser and then the nurse inside told me it will take a minimum of 8 hours to see a doctor. I met a man who was waiting for 13 hours just to see a doctor. During my time at the hospital there were so many cases but no treatment only waiting. This situation is bad and needs urgent attention from one and all. Kindly look into this to make the system better an value human life be it patients & /or NHS staff. Thank you.

When I receive a generic letter like this, I'm sure I'm not the only one and there's a BIG problem. So I called 0800 707 60 60. The call handler blamed Royal Mail. I also complained about being cut-off while in the telephone queue. The call handler blamed it being Monday, saying they were very busy. I'm a big fan of the NHS but they need to sort these issues out with out blaming Royal Mail and Monday's. If anyone from the Bowel Cancer Screening Programme read my story I would prefer them not to reply with a Disney Talk apology as I find it insulting."

2904,Access to 24 pharmacy experience - Was advised to go to A&E one weekend recently due to a high temperature following an operation at a different hospital. Triage and session with doctor were very good and timely and I felt listened to and addressing my concerns. I was given a prescription for antibiotics and my wife asked at the reception desks whether they knew of a 24 hour chemist (it was close to midnight at that stage). The hospital does not have a 24 pharmacy on site and the staff on reception could not advise of a 24 hour pharmacy local to the hospital. They gave us a sheet with local pharmacies and their opening times...but that did not address the question of a pharmacy open at that time of night. Calling 111 did not help either and in the end I took the decision to wait until 9am the following morning when my wife was able to go to a pharmacy to get my prescription. I was fortunate that I was already on some prescribed medication following the operation. I am not sure what I would have done if I had not been in that position and not being able to get my prescribed medication from my A&E visit.

703,"sort out your telephone lines! I had a missed call when I couldn't answer the phone in that moment and when I call back, no one has a clue what's going on and there's no one to help! As soon as I said I had a missed call the operator said 'I can't help you with that i'm afraid'. abysmal for a private service! Cant believe that in a response they are actually saying they are being targeted with poor reviews- maybe look into the issues that are being raised instead. Absolutely shocking."

Each and every time all staff have been exemplary. Recently I had to visit during the covid crisis for a gallbladder attack. Again the service was amazing. Ppe was used and social distancing measures in place and adhered to. On admission to ward 2 the service continued as excellent and again on admission to ward 22. EVERY member of staff were SUPERB. I was offered surgery as an emergency and a cancellation became available. My treatment from admission to discharge was brilliant. I unfortunately have had cause to revisist a and e, ward 2 ward 22 and today ward 21. Again, every single staff member were great. I could not have asked for a better experience in a very upsetting and worrying time for me. To the wonderful young man who scooped me up in the a and e reception and reassured me and took me into triage, I will never forget you. And to everyone else who looked after me, thank you so much.

4337,"Hysteroscopy - I am 58 years old and was referred for a hysteroscopy /biopsies to Leic Royal Infirmary due to abnormal bleeding. The letter came the day before my appointment & I was very agitated when I read the info and what to expect. It stated in the letter that if an individual really didn't want to have the procedure in clinic then there was the option to have it done under GA. Once I'd done some research I was in a complete state of terror, also knowing a friend who had had it pre menopause and said it was as bad as her 3 births, and had been totally traumatised and upset. When I went for the appointment I explained I did not want to have the procedure unless I could have a GA. My consultant was completely fine with this and added me to a list. I then had the whole thing 2 weeks later at Leic General Hospital under a spinal block. All staff were kind and caring and I didnt feel a thing. In my opinion it is barbaric to do it without anaesthesia."

They was other 2-3 people with 1 kid and he dint bother to tell them off but rather pick on me . As well as that they was so many other people with no masks on .

And in a waiting room with 2 parents not wearing masks, with one openly coughing and with no staff challenging them.

3438,"NHS Podiatry Services - I feel the podiatry service within Bolton NHS is an absolute shamble. Despite repeatedly explaining my dad needed an early appointment in the morning due to his mobility needs and disability he kept getting sent PM appointments, clashing with local schools coming out and parents of school children using the health centre car park which was not being monitored so there was nowhere for us to park to help dad attend a PM usually after 3pm appointment. Each and every appointment that came through the post was made for after 3pm, a time when my dad is half asleep due to the amount of medication he is on. I have repeatedly asked for AM appointments, and this is noted on his health records for more than two years but each and every time I try to change the appointment to AM there are no appointments available. The other issue is what exactly are podiatry in the NHS doing in these appointments other than cutting toenails, this is not a complete podiatry services, I drop off my dad and within 10 minutes of going in for his appointment he is coming back out again and I am guessing it takes him two minutes to take his socks and shoes on and off, so about six minutes is perhaps the actual podiatry appointment which is just pointless. My dad's is constantly complaining his feet cause him problems, but no-one takes on his woes during the appointment. Decided to take dad to a private podiatrist I have used for more than 8 years, because I would rather he paid for a service through his state pension than keep suffering with the poorly run NHS podiatry service we have in Bolton. And this poorly run service has nothing to do with Covid-19 as the service has been like this for many years."

5983,Everything was well organised.Had to wait a short time but once in the system it was very efficient and quick.
3497,The doctors were very nice
496,"Don't know - Thank you to the A&E team - I was referred to this hospital by Stroud and advised of the hour and half wait by Stroud and when I registered at the desk. One I was called in for triage and then for treatment everyone made it very clear what to expect, discussed options and treatment. One particular nurse looked after me with cleaning the wound and then after stapling made sure all was fine. She showed great kindness allowing me time to recover before pick up. The consultant and doctor were equally clear in the treatment and were efficient in completing the treatment. I repeatedly heard the team apologising for the delay, but there we a lot of people in for treatment and a lot of people working on a Saturday to process the patients, so they were doing a great job, without from what I saw compromising the care and dignity of patients. They seemed to be a great team, communicating easily, getting things done and the kindness shown to me I saw the same to others in the same treatment area. Brilliant and Thank you BTW the information pamphlets were great for myself and my wife "
7487,Excellent team of professionals.
187,Children's & Adolescent Services - World class care - thank you to the children's A&E team - My 1 year old was referred to the paediatric team by the GP. Immediately on arrival we were triaged by a lovely nurse and student. A short while later we were seen by the paediatric SHO - he was extremely thorough and my son adored him. The waiting room and consulting room were comfortable and clean. There was ample space for patients to keep an appropriate distance. All staff were wearing masks. We then saw the registrar and later the consultant who were both excellent. They took my concerns seriously and managed to get to the bottom of what was wrong with my son. The nursing staff monitored his condition throughout our time in the department. The staff in x-ray were also very friendly and efficient. We then waited on the PAU for blood results and the staff there were fantastic too. I was particularly impressed by how supportive everyone was of breastfeeding - when I visited a few years ago with my eldest son there was room for improvement so I am very pleased that NMH are implementing current guidelines to support breastfeeding until the child is 2 years and beyond. My only suggestion would be to install some vending machines in the waiting area if possible as it would have been nice to get a cup of tea -I understand only one parent being able to attend but it would be ideal to get some refreshments after waiting for an extended time. But overall we had a brilliant experience - I could not be more pleased. Please pass on my thanks to the whole department. When you have an unwell child you really want to feel you are in safe hands so well done children's A&E and the paediatric team. 
6095,"General Surgery - 75 year old's 1st surgical procedure - I recently underwent a Spigelian hernia surgical repair at LRI, the care, kindness & treatment I received over a two day period was outstanding.

6875,Positive Experience with Psychiatrist - I saw a particular doctor with Ealing CATT for a mental health assessment. I had a wonderful experience; the doctor was incredibly helpful and kind. He talked to my in depth about my medical and mental health history and provided useful treatment options moving forwards to help with my depression and anxiety. It was such a relief to know that I had a doctor that truly cared about my treatment and was happy to assist. Thank you so much to the entire team.
4288,"Just to say thanks to @SouthendNHS for looking after my wife Sue again this week. Especially the paramedics and staff in the Balmoral ward previously, and the Stambridge and Chalkwell wards this week."

8342,Massive thank you to the staff at Queen Vic in EG and East Surrey Hospital today my son came off his bike today and sliced his groin area really bad that he had to have stitches with everything going on with COVD they made a very anxious and worried little boy (and Mummy) at ease with it all and make it feel less scary. The staff in the cold area of child assessment A&E were amazing with my 2 children and so friendly
5060,"Staff are really helpful, they offer great care, they do good lunches and snacks they have many different wards and Ward blocks so it can hold a lot of patients"

8994,No one there - My doctor won't give me an appointment to remove a post surgery dressing. Told I must ring ponteland road and go there. No one is answering the phone! 
8589,"Efficient COVID-19 Testing Hub - No problems experienced; helpful & informative information beforehand. Bungalow for swab test was well signposted. Pleasant Nurse appeared as soon as I arrived; did test and I departed. Result (negative) arrived next day. I cannot think of any way in which the service could be improved. I hope it wont be necessary, but if it was, I would use this service again."

1269,"Definitely DO NOT recommend Urgent Care Centre as nurses act like they are a qualified surgeon or a doctor, didn't happen once- it happened twice. You can go there with hand chopped off and cocky nurses would tell you that is all okay and no treatment needed. I went there with post op complications (my wound reopened) was told by nurses that stitches are not required, ended up with a massive hole on my neck for 5 days (Bank hols) went to see gp, was told that stitches are required, we got in touch with surgeon who confirmed that I need stitches. I ended up travelling away to another hospital to have my stitches sorted. I really hope that those rough nurses don't call themselves a NHS heros... won't catch me clapping for them."
6097,Pain Management - Very caring staff and doctor - Lovely helpful staff . Lovely understanding doctor . No waiting couldn't of done more . Doctor said if I need to see him again do not hesitate to book appointment 
5384,"The reality of covid 19 for our family meant that we could not be with our nana in her final days however we would just like to say thank you to the ladies of ward C2 at DPOW. Because of them we got to FaceTime our nana on a regular basis and she was surrounded by pictures of us all and messages. They also gave her the best care possible and provided us with regular updates. We cannot tell you how much they have helped us in this very difficult time and unprecedented time.

6420,"My late father - Sadly my late father was diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer on the 19th January this year.It was a very difficult time for all the family, especially for my elderly mother, who will be 90 in July. She nursed my father at home as he didn't want to die in hospital.The District nurses were all amazing and made my dad as comfortable as they could. Nothing was too much trouble and their care and compassion was second to none. My father very sadly passed away on the 12th of March but we will be forever grateful for their care and support."
5871,"Excellent hospital with dedicated staff. Attended the QE at various points over the last forty years, and having parents and relatives the age they are, means I've also done lots of 'visiting'. The care my parents, relatives, friends of elderly parents have received has always been first class. The hospital is also very 'joined-up' in it's communication with patients local GP's, Social Care and after care. Quite surprised on here to read the negative reviews by some - it obviously must be frustrating if waiting in A & E for a few hours. However I'm sure all staff do their very best on limited resources, in what must be at times difficult circumstances. The NHS is free for everyone, with some of best Health Care professionals in the world - many of whom appeared to working Xmas day when I visited my sick 84 year old mother on Xmas day! "
4081,Admitted as an emergency with Sepsis discharged with a box of tablets three hours later ........ good job my GP (who was very angry!!) is looking after me and knows what he's doing ........ I get severe anxiety when going in here from past experiences ..........
3446,"The online Birth & Beyond Classes have been absolutely brilliant! I would definitely recommend them as they have been super helpful sessions and, even virtually, Clare does a fantastic job of getting essential information across in an entertaining way and answering our questions. My husband and I actually found it was even easier to join the online sessions than attending any kind of in person ones, because you just join the video chat from home and you can be there in your pjs and sit wherever is most comfy! So I would say absolutely don't hesitate to join the online classes instead of the in person ones - you will be missing out if you don't do them! "

They kept us informed every step of the way about PERSON's progress and knowing that they were all so passionate about loving and caring for the babies on the unit, gave us PERSON of mind when we had to leave him. I can't thank them enough for everything they did for PERSON and us from the moment he was born, they really are angels in disguise who only passed through our lives for 9 weeks but have made such an impact that it will last forever.

3189,"Worst experience I had with an hospital, went there for a surgeon consultation was sent for an US. Machine broke the day of the appointment they called one hour before my appointment just got me on the door. Reschedule for the day after, went there US hugely expensive cost me almost 600 pounds (consultation was paid apart). Is been 45 days since the consultation and I am still waiting a reply from the surgeon which told me will contact me by email, even if I asked him should i book another appointment to discuss the result I was even so stupid to offer to pay again for this pitiful treatment. Sent multiple emails with no result just excuse on holiday first then total silence. If you want to waste your money for a poor service this is the right place to go otherwise stay away."
2883,"Outstanding professional service - Hi, I've just come home from a spell on your vascular ward, the staff are amazing, friendly, courteous nothing was too much trouble even when staffing levels were stretched. They are a credit to you especially a young junior sister whose name evades me. She was exceptional in her bedside manner the way she conducted herself was beyond reproach. Please pass on my greatest thanks at what was a difficult time for me and at a time where you guys are busy. Everyone from your HCAs upto your senior ward staff deserve more praise than they actually receive. Stay safe Darren Jaye"

7384,"Adult Mental Illness - Dreadful practice - Uncaring staff, very rude on the phone, not showing patients around the ward not feeding patients who are isolating whist waiting for COVID swabs to come back!!! Ignoring patient when asking for an extra blanket when they are cold. The reason my daughter asked for a blanket because she was cold was clear when the assistant came in to change her bed and asked her where the duvet was? She was told ‚Äúwhat duvet I have not had one‚Äù all that was on the bed was a duvet cover which is plastic on one side!!! So she had total nights without a duvet only the cover and not one of the nurses had noticed there was no duvet on the bed!!! Unbelievable that mental health patients are treat like that!!! "

The room I was in with the other 3 lads was clean and tidy and comfortable. Hope the othe lads recover well also. I would like to thank the surgeon and his staff for the amazing work they do under pressure and low staffing.

2205,Intensive Care - Transplant Ward - Can't say enough how the staff looked after my wife during her stay in Wytham Ward and Intensive Care.Also the Doctors and Nurses they come out to my car from Renal Outpatients when she went into a coma when travelling up to our weekly check up.Quickly got her into Intensive Care and almost certainly saved her life! She's doing fine now thankfully thanks to the wonderful staff.
4699,"Why are only the staff on amu, icu, dcc and respiratory wards given the correct ppe? Why are you warning staff not to post their concerns on social media? Why are you not ordering any more hair nets? Why did you give staff masks that were not fit for use and then recall them after weeks? Why won't you give staff the correct ppe unless their ward has 24 or more positive covid patients on? Most of the staff have become infected already! Ask the local community for help and it will help you, you need to be speaking out about this not helping the government cover it up! These are people's lives! "
7520,"I am overwhelmed at the care I'm receiving at Charing Cross. Every single health care professional in Breast services has been wonderful, from Radiologists, my surgical team, anaesthetists, theatre staff, doctors, nurses from Riverside ward, breast care nurses to oncologists. They include and support me in all the decisions I make. I get the warmest of welcomes at the foyer, it's a friendly hospital. I'm so happy with the exemplary care and cannot thank them enough for their kindness."

I've had the best care from everyone during a very difficult time with the Covid Virus making things difficult for all patients and NHS Staff. I was cared for with great respect and dedication. Everyone in both hospitals have been respectful of all my concerns, I was supported in every way from friendly and positive people. All Staff were brilliant. Even Domestic Staff, Porters and Students. Thank you all the Operating Staff and everyone involved in my care. Even after my coming home I was followed up with great care and concern from Drs.

They will make your life a living hell! And your life is literally in their hands. They are like pigeons pecking an injured bird to death or bullies ganging up on the weak child in the playground, who should have known not to tell the teacher. You wouldn't believe how evil these so-called health professionals can be so please take care."
6541,Neurology - Amazing care and support - I really cannot thank the doctor and her team for all their professional care and help you have given and continue to give. My husband and I are so impressed and feel so grateful for all the help and support the doctor shows to us. Thank you.. Louise Breden 
490,"Urology - Excellent care - This was my first experience of being an inpatient, so I was a little apprehensive. However the professionalism of the excellent nursing staff soon put me at my ease. The medical team explained what was happening throughout and their high standards generated an air of calm. The nursing care during the operation was very attentive, caring and reassuring. The post operation care was excellent and the nursing staff were exceptional. All staff were very friendly and made the experience as good as it could have been. I hope I don't have to be a patient again, but if I am this is the hospital I would like to attend. A big thank you to everyone involved."
4666,"I had a great experience and was very well taken care of. Although my baby was meant to have turned in the delivery position after discovering her breach position in my late pregnancy, she did not actually turn. I went in for induction at 40w+12 and refused it, as did not want to interrupt the natural process. I asked for a sweep instead which I had previously refused. This is when the midwife figured out something was wrong - she was in a breach position before week 40 and the midwife thought she turned however this did not happen. My baby was the first one being scanned with a little hand scanner and they found her head crown in the upper side of the bump. I did not like the labour doctor's attitude trying to convince me to get induced, who was so negative in presenting the facts to me as if I was about to kill my baby. However Dr Gorry who took over was amazing. She performed ECV on me very carefully which was sadly unsuccessful. She then looked after us during the emergency c section, all this while explaining every step of each process and all the risks involved in an empathetic way. The surgery was a success of course and all the doctors were amazing explaining everything they were doing to me. Although being discharged took 3h as the evening / night had started their shift, overall the Whipps Cross maternity team was amazing at handling us and making sure we were safe before being discharged. Another let down was the night shift - midwife and student - who were unable to offer any breastfeeding advice sadly most probably due to lack of personal experience, both being very young. The student attended all my calls and I've seen the midwife only at the beginning and end of her shift, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Huge thanks to everyone who looked after us, from the ladies changing my baby and the bed sheets to the doctors and midwives present there for you any time! "

568,The night staff. They are abusive and intimidating.. My mum's on Linden ward and is petrified of the night staff. The lady opposite her discharged herself today in a fraught state because of this. There is also a consultant that came to see my mum who was also rude to say the least and was more interested in showing off to the junior doctors it seemed. I have reported all this to the day staff on Linden ward but to be honest my dogs treated better at the vets.
5113,Big thanks to @SCAS999 & @UHSFT for their swift action & care in seeing my dad today and treating him for a TIA.

Went to E&I with my 5 months pregnant fiance, for a head scan, send from our GP, with a recomande letter, waited 6 hours in the waiting area, just for a doctor to take her blood pressure and a urine sample, and saying her to go home and have some rest. That's after a nurse asked her what is she doing there only with a headeche. Need to say that her headeche is constant for the past month, and being pregnant is quite worrying. Incompetent, rude and definitely abusive staff of a hospital."

3029,"Trauma services - My knee op - If a hospital admission for day surgery could be described as lovely / amazing then this was it. I had elective knee surgery following an injury a few years ago and was nervous. I was happy to go out of Area as I Live in Derby. All the doctors / surgeons, anaesthetist and nurses, and other staff who may have had input, were just amazing. Everything was explained by each specialist and I was given the choice on what I wanted and they accommodated my wishes 100 percent.I may well need more surgery at some point in the future and would be more than happy to return so to all the staff in the Diagnostic and Treatment Centre I want to say a huge thank you from the bottom of my heart for making a stressful situation for me a very relaxed and happy one "

3072,"Very unprofessional - Since my son took part in the attention and interaction group Nov / Dec 19 I kept calling to request his medical record from his S&L therapist. I always get a message that someone will call me back to discuss it with me and nobody ever does. The only way one can get a reply from them is by sending an official letter requesting their child's medical records according to the Data Protection Act. In my case they have 15 more days to reply before I take things further. If you can, avoid the Acorn Centre!! Both my son's Paeditrician and his S&L therapist have failed to spot what was wrong with my son. If you can afford and want to see some results in your child development, go privately. Otherwise, be prepared to have a lot of patience or take things further. "

Then the whole staff and doctors were promptly waiting for me in each section of the hospital. I had a full consultation at the breast centre. They immediately sent me to a mammogram procedure then to a scan. The results were immediate and I am very satisfied. The parking lot was crowded and I paid 2, 20 for 1 hour approximately."

6325,"Gynaecology - Thank you - I had to visit this department on several occasions over two weeks in April 2021 when I suffered a miscarriage. The staff were caring, kind and sensitive. I was given important information more than once, I was also given the information in writing. The staff I spoke to checked I understood what my options were and gave me numerous opportunities to ask questions. I was told that I could change my mind at any point, even once I had decided a way forward. When I left, I was told I could call the department at any time. I had to call the department once afterwards and I was met with the same kind, considerate and sensitive care. I want to say a massive thank you to the members of staff who helped me over those two weeks, they made what was a very traumatic time, that little bit more bearable. "

I had a head injury, advised by ambulance team for ct scan etc. As I arrived at the hospital I was laying with the head blocks on for good half hour before a doctor came just to remove them and give me codeine and discharge me? . Never been treated like this in any london hospitals. The doctor seemed like he didnt care. I clearly stated my head had been injured I had a bump across my left side of my head. Instead he was lifting my top asking if I had stomach pains. 2 days on feeling drowsy will definitely go to a ANE here in london."

4814,i would recommend the ambulance service usually they are all brilliant. except for last night after a paramedic failed to book my 8 month old prem baby in after she had rolled off our bed and banged her head. we was left sat in the waiting area for hours and nobody even knew we was there because they didnt do the handover! when i confronted doctors at the hospital why i was still sat waiting after numerous children was in and out being seen my daughter had no obs done or any...thing the whole time we were there waiting because they were all completely unaware we was there and had to retake our details... not to mention the paramedic was falling asleep in the back of the ambulance on the way to the hospital.... all paramedics do an amazing job but last night couldve easily been avoided if anything wouldve happened to my daughter those paramedics wouldve been held responsible!

7208,Worst experience ever. They don't care they just leave you there for hours and hours and they tell you also it can take from 5 to 10 hours until they see you. Awful. Also they brought a person with covid in the room with people without.
6621,"ENT Pre COVID longer than 6 month wait for an appointment and a 2.5 hour wait to be seen. Endoscopy if you are lucky, no other equipment. They want you in and out as quick as possible so a referral to another department is a great get out clause. Patient discharged and patient made to feel like some one cares. If you are discharged after your first appointment you will be waiting another 6 months if you are still unwell or sprays are unsuccessful, you are not under someones care. To get seen, to get properly assessed, to have your basic scans read (turns out they were not fully on the system in the first place), to be listened to it's a battle. A battle when you are unwell, it's hard. The team never pick up the phone and at an appointment I witnessed it for myself. Understaffed and no doubt underfunded."
5412,excellent in every way a very through investigation into my condition staff were great thank you NHSD a fantastic institution

3633,"Lack of provision of mental health service - My 17 year old son developed symptoms of severe depression 10 weeks before his 18th birthday. His GP prescribed an antidepressant and told us that they would like to refer him to CAMHS but couldn't because he was too close to being 18 when the adult service would take over. Suggested some NHS counselling services but when contacted they replied that they were unable to offer him anything until he was 18. He deteriorated further and 2 weeks later had a serious suicide attempt, ending up in hospital. He was told he would see a DPN from CAMHS prior to Discharge. He waited 6 hours for someone to come who told us that they were actually not a proper member of the crisis team. We asked about his ongoing antidepressant medication and were told that it would be discussed at the crisis team MDT the following day and his GP would be contacted. He was made a follow up appointment with the crisis team 10 days later. The outcome of the MDT was not communicated promptly to his GP who had to chase it up and in fact was advised not to give any further medication - however, fortunately our GP started another drug anyway. The follow up appointment was with a ‚Äòpractioner' and health care assistant who offered no suggestions for treatment and was a total waste of time. They again told us to contact the counselling services who had already turned him down. Our GP received no communication from them and tried to speak to a consultant, but this was unhelpful. He has remained very ill and has had absolutely no treatment offered by CAMHS for 8 weeks. My husband and I both work within the NHS and in both of our services there is proper provision for 17 year olds to transition across to adult services. The CAMHS service needs to improve this quickly before more young people in their moment of need are failed. We have the resources to take matters into our own hands and have arranged a private psychiatric review and private counselling for our son - many others would not have the resources to do this."
4538,had to wait a bit for decisions
6918,I was kept informed of the procedure throughout the process and was cared for by excellent staff who were friendly and professional.
3819,Very efficient service particularly under the present conditions short wait and good treatment !
1986,"I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety here back in 2017. When I asked about the possibility of me potentially having depression too, I was asked, 'do you have a constant low mood? ', which I replied with 'no, I don't.' And was told that, due to me not having a constant low mood, I was not depressed. After my diagnosis, they refused to give me therapy. Instead, I had to refer myself to a therapy (which wasn't CAMHS). I later did apply to be on the waiting list for CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) and did eventually get therapy from them in late 2018, though this was only for a couple of weeks until they mysteriously stopped seeing me and I recieved nothing from them since in regards to my appointments. When I was doing the CBT therapy, I was traumatised after a previous event online about 2 months before I got the therapy. The therapist simply just said to me, 'you don't have it otherwise you'd be having flashbacks all the time' and instead, provided me with an online safety magazine which triggered a mental breakdown. I nearly killed myself several times due to the lack of therapy I've had over the past 4 years. I simply had to just help myself get better, seeing as no one from this hospital could be bothered to help me. If anyone is thinking about going to this hospital or is being referred to this hospital, I'm begging you, don't go there. Consider my story. Consider the lives that were lost here due to suicide, because the next life lost due to this poor hospital could be you."

9590,As expected
6742,COVID-19 Drive-Through testing - I had not undergone a test like this before and was a little nervous and apprehensive. The professionalism and good humour of the attending nurse dispelled these feelings straight away: Her skill transformed a process which was somewhat unpleasant into an event we could smile about. What a star - thank you! 
1749,Excellent service. Great hospital. Dr James and team was excellent.
2799,Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) the best children's hospital. I've been coming here since 2016 for my child and have always met children friendly staff members and have never experienced any poor service. Thank you to all the great staff at GOSH.

7060,Accident and emergency services - Minor injuries unit - excellent experience - I went to Whipps Cross A and E at lunchtime on 10 February 2021 having fallen and hurt my wrist. Registration and triage were very efficient and I was quickly referred to the Minor Injuries Unit. I was seen immediately by a lovely nurse who sent me for x-ray. When I returned with x-rays showing a broken wrist she gently bandaged it with a plaster cast. In total I was in the hospital not much more than an hour after I first walked into A and E. I was told I would be contacted by the fracture clinic within 72 hours for review but was in fact called the next day and offered an appointment for review / permanent cast for the 15th February. Please pass on my thanks to all the staff concerned (I'm sorry I can't remember the nurse's name) for their high level of professionalism and kindness. I am very grateful.
1437,"Just had a virtual consult @GSTTnhs. I nearly self-discharged because my symptoms were so much better but I'm pleased I didn't. A refreshingly holistic discussion and came away with therapeutic options to consider, yet the reassurance that I don't need regular f / u. Very grateful! "

After being triaged and a seen by a practice nurse, I was told to wait till my condition worsen (which it did) and see my GP -wrong answer. The whole process took well over 2 hours 30mins. Mine was not a medical emergency but one which did required medical treatment."

9432,"A mystery illness - Throughout the months of May, June and July earlier this year, I suffered from a mysterious infection, probably viral. At my GP Practice several young, keen and very committed young GP's tried to find the root of the problem which seemed to be bedeviling me. I had been prescribed a course anti-biotics in the hope that this might serve to eradicate the chest infection: but to no avail! My general well-being seemed to deteriorate as we moved through August, so another of the young GP's at my Practice sent me in to the Acute Monitoring Unit, (AMU), at the Northern General Hospital here in Sheffield. Here, they kept me under observation over 36 hours since there seemed to be conflicting symptoms which made it very difficult for the various Specialists that examined me to arrive at a confirmed diagnosis. Over the following three or four weeks I was had a Brain Scan, many Blood tests, Chest X-Rays, Scans and Ultra-Sound examinations, ECG and Echo Cardiogram tests and finally a Biopsy, all of which enabled the final diagnosis of Temporal Arteritis to be established. Throughout this time I was not merely impressed by the care, attention and dedication of the Doctors, Nursing and Auxiliary Staff but I felt massively reassured by their professionalism in keeping me informed of their thoughts, suspicions and finally, conclusions about my condition at every stage. I never felt that at any time that my questions, however naive or basic, were ever treated with anything but complete commitment and support. In gy googling my symptoms, I gave myself some disturbing moments but the care and attention to detail by the Medical Staff helped re-establish my peace of mind gave me total confidence that we would finally get to the bottom of this conundrum and we could all move on to making me better. When I first went into the AMU at the Northern General, my pulse rate and blood pressure were noticeably higher than usual. As a result of the confidence that the excellent Doctors at the Northern General instilled in me and my indulging in Mindfulness meditation, these blood pressure and pulse rate numbers were significantly reduced. I can only thank and praise the Medical and Nursing Staff at both the Northern General and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals for the care, dedication and professionalism that they showed. The Auxiliary and Support Workers were cheerful, helpful and committed to my general comfort and well-being and added to my overall sense of trust and satisfaction that we would get to the bottom of my problems. As for the young GP's at the Carterknowle and Dore Practice I must say a hearty Thank You for their dedicated commitment to making me better despite the confusing and almost contradictory symptoms that I presented. I am now back on top form and feel a massive debt of gratitude!! Our National Health Service, as demonstrated in"
6496,"Many negative reviews which don't appreciate how understaffed, underfunded, and overworked the NHS is right now. We are so lucky to have this hospital. I had to go to A&E and was very impressed with the doctors and nurses."

2237,"Never really saw any nursing staff - It feels like this ward is the dumping ward of the hospital. Never really saw any nursing staff, just a wonderful healthcare assistant. Again never saw the same doctor twice and each one changed their diagnosis. When my daughter questioned diagnosis and treatment she was told she was being aggressive (seems you cannot ask about or question decision). Visitors told their allocated visiting slot to avoid covid, yet, patients who are able, get into lift and meet family / friends in the Costa coffee shop. I almost had tests for the patient who had been discharged from my bed. I was admitted with pneumonia, still trying to work out why I had tests for gall stones and got diagnosed with an overactive bladder? (which I dont have). Discharged after 2 days as fit with some antibiotics."

Yes, he had to wait for 9hrs, but the staff were lovely and made him a bed up in a quiet corridor until a bed in AMU freed up. With limited space and facilities I feel the staff went above and beyond .Thanking you all and hope the NHS soon gets the extra funding it so desperately needs to continue providing the excellent care to all patients."

Also the electronic board was not working to say where you were in the queue. I did hear people a bit agitated that their log in on arrival had not worked. How lucky are we to have dedicated people working for the NHS."

209,NHS 111 (online) recommended I book an appointment to help the process through A&E. I booked 2:30pm but was asked to arrive early if I could to avoid overcrowding. I arrived at 2pm but when I got to A&E nobody knew such a booking facility existed. My appointment was for an eye condition and I waited in A&E for 5 hours before seeing a doctor who subsequently referred me to the eye unit where I had to wait a further 3 hours. (8hours in total). The NHS 111 booing system isnt working

9003,"Accident and emergency services - Treated amazingly - I went to A&E after having a mental health crisis and the psychiatric and mental health nurses were absolutely amazing to me and helped me feel so much better whilst I waited for an assessment. One nurse in particular checked in on me regularly and gave me plenty of food and when I was discharged at the end of her shift, she came and gave me some advice and wished me well in my recovery. It's a shame that the mental health services are so underfunded in this country and people have to resort to A&E but I felt very safe and happy waiting there."

9789,What a nightmare. Had a 2 o'clock appointment for my 1st covid injection got seen at 3.30 Had to queue With around 100 people outside in the freezing cold. How is this a good idea. It was impossible to stand 2 meters apart . In the queue we're old vulnerable people . In the time I was there 3 people actually fainted after being on there feet for so long . The staff are so busy they don't have the time to offer any kind of direction at all. Won't be going back there for my second injection that's for sure .

3016,"Maternity services - Disgusted and uncared for - I am currently under the Whittington team of midwives. I am disgusted at the care I have received, or should I say have not received in my greatest time of need. When you are in need of midwife advice you will be waiting upto a week for a response. Regardless what number you call you will not get through. There is no point having these telephone numbers written on the yellow book and being advised to call if you need anything if when you do call you are left with no answer. I have asked numerous times who my midwife is what team I'm under and no one can tell me. I am left in the dark about my care. There is one midwife in particular who has actually been quite efficient and helpful but this is only during our scheduled appointments. I was told I needed a vital prescription and due to me testing positive for covid they would be able to send someone out to my house to give it to me. When I tried to arrange this no one had ever heard of this protocol and they were happy for me to not pick it up and potentially risk mine and my babies life. Another doctor in the A&E department told me to just pretend I don't have Covid and pick up the prescription myself from the pharmacy. I wonder how many other patients with covid they are advising to pretend they don't have covid and show up and walk around the hospital. Although staff come across as friendly I am honestly so disgusted at the care from the team. They don't really care, they all just give different information to each other and fob you off to the next teammate and ultimately do not provide adequate care. After my recent visits I am now looking to be referred to another hospital for my midwifery care. "
741,"This is a trust, where employees treated like numbers, without respect or consideration given to an individual, with lack of respect whatsoever! And God helps you if you happen to be a minority..."
3501,Minor injuries unit - Fantastic care - Was so impressed with all the nurses and staff. They treated our 10 year old boy with such care & attention. Made him feel so relaxed and at ease during his procedure. They managed to turn what could have been a traumatic experience into an adventure. Huge respect. Thank you!

2405,"My daughter was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in feb 2020. As we all know this has been a hard year and on top of everything my 6 year old has dealt with T1D. We have received nothing but first class care since diagnosis. However one thing that really stands out is that As Christmas approached my daughter became worried that she might hypo during the night on Christmas Eve, as she often has. She would get upset, no matter how we tried to reassure her, that Santa wouldn't come b...ecause she would be awake. I mentioned it to her nurse (Helen) in her clinic (Paediatric Diabetes) just as a passing comment really, not asking or expecting anything to happen. But unbeknownst to us She then spoke to the play team. About a week before Christmas, this amazing package arrived for my daughter. There was a letter from Santa and a Christmas activity for her. The letter from Santa reassured my daughter that Santa knew about her diagnosis but that no child was ever forgotten on Christmas Eve. A small little act that bought such relief and happiness to my daughter. Not on a life saving scale but beyond appreciated. I could have cried! So very thoughtful! "
5147,"Came by ambulance with blue light & siren so got attended to straight away. My experience was traumatic but saved my life, so for me the staff are highly professional and I owe them everything.

Having given birth at different hospitals King's College was my favourite by far. My partner and I are extremely grateful for the care they have provided. What I really appreciated at the time was they allow partner to stay. I think for women who has just given birth it is so important to have that help. I would have paid private just to have that help if needed but I did not. I felt completely at ease and safe. Thank you for delivery our beautiful baby girl. "

9745,"Rude phlebotomist and outpatient receptionist - I had a very bad experience at the phlebotomy unit in Beckenham Becon hospital today.My consultant sent an online request for blood test and advised me to do it in the morning itself . I arrived at phlebotomy unit and took the token. Waited for one hour and the number on the board was not moving at all. One person was called in an hour and the token number was not moving after again .After waiting one hour I pointed out this to the lady in the reception And the reply from her was horrible. She told me to go and sit there in a loud noise. She said the number is moving you go and sit there . They will call . I was shocked but an old gentle man came to the scene and told the lady the same concern . Then she went in and came back and said they will call. From the next moment they started to call the token number.They said they are keeping the appointments in time. I can understand that but they should consider people taken the token and waiting for hours aswell. The phlebotomist who took my blood was very unprofessional.No Viser, with one glouse in one hand and the same glouse to use the computer .She attempted twice and didn't get the blood which can be understandable but she was fishing my vein to get the blood.now my hand is bruised and very painful.she was very rude and I am so upset.I am a nurse by profession and when I see these unprofessional things I thought this should be addressed in review .I am on immunosuppressant therapy and there may be so many patients coming there with same . It is our the health care professionals responsibility to follow the guidelines for the safety of patients and ourselve. Please consider this as a concern. Thank u."

I was at my lowest of lows but the staff within A&E and Disney ward and the security guards that also... work within Scunthorpe general hospital did an amazing job at looking after me, helping me throughout my worst and keeping me safe. They've saved my life countless times and I'm forever grateful for that.

I'm not sure if she is a nurse or doctor - I was in such a state I couldn't be sure. However, I remember seeing her before when I had to take my friend to hospital. She was absolutely brilliant with my friend, who was really struggling with anxiety - her head was all over the place and the lady was so calm and sympathetic.

The nurse unnecessarily told me she had to treat me as if I had covid. Funnily enough I was aware of the global pandemic. I had to pick up my scan picture the following day ahead of surgery and was placed on a ward full of pregnant people whilst I waited. Lack of tact, sympathy and care. Despite this being my local hospital I will never attend again. Had to turn to external charities for bereavement support as zero information given to me. I hope no other women are subjected to this experience"

I had a bad fall at the indoor ski centre in Castleford and knew I had really hurt myself as soon as I went over the jump and landed on my back. I was terrified as my hands went numb and I couldn't move them at one point, I was convinced I was going to be paralysed as I work in Neuro and spinal trauma surgery so my mind was overthinking. It was the scariest moment of my life so far and I am just so grateful for our NHS, being on the other side is awful but makes me realise how amazing it really is. Please pass on my thanks to the staff who dealt with me, they were amazing, so professional showed excellent compassion in their individual practice and reassured me as I was in shock and rather hysterical thinking I was paralysed. I really can't thank them enough. I had a CT and it was clear thank the lord so I am just taking it easy and when I ski again will not be doing any jumps what so ever and will be taking it very slowly. Thank you again and keep up the amazing work you all do! "

2011,Maternity services - Amazing care - Came in for induction due to health condition on 5th July and was welcomed in my own room and was very well looked after by everyone who was on ward 17. From every stage of the process I felt in safe hands and had everyone at the press of a button if I needed. When I went to delivery suite the care was incredible and during and post birth I felt the team had my best interest at heart and the safety of my and the baby as paramount. They worked together to help me safely deliver the baby and helped achieve my wishes on my birth plan where possible. The after care whilst I remained in the suite was amazing and I cannot thank everyone enough for helping deliver our beautiful son safely. 
5749,A simple thank you and please wouldn't hurt anyone. Being nice does not cost anything. Emergency department staff mostly receptionists.

8606,"Lack of empathy - I had been ringing the service for the last 3 days, only for the call to just ring out. After losing the will to live, I finally got through. I was told I couldn't be seen as there was no staff and bookable appointments were only offered. I fully understand the strange and difficult times we find ourselves, and understand things are not like before, but I really needed help with receiving my meds. I felt totally fobbed off. Trying to explain my situation to the girl about the urgency of the medication I needed, was just falling on deaf ears. Staff are not bothered, disengaged and have no empathy. The reason I was calling was because I had only been sent a certain amount of pills through the post, leaving me with the difficulty of gaining my meds again, at a later date. Felt totally dismissed and discounted. "

1728,"The Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth is NOT a pleasant experience and I would not recommend it to anyone! The ‚Äòhospice' is paid for by overcharging innocent patients - unacceptable! Top management are absolutely useless and corruption is rife! Management have no consideration for the staff whatsoever and having spoken to others this applies to all other departments. Management treat staff as a number not human beings with feelings. Management do not appreciate the work we do. Bullying is rife and brushed under the carpet, despite the paper ticking exercise of ‚ÄòMandatory Training'. If the corrupt top management were replaced with people who knew how to manage their staff efficiently with the consideration and respect they deserve, it would be a much more pleasant and happier place to work for all concerned!

8295,My 90 year old Grandad is being discharged today having recovered from COVID. I am so proud! So grateful to @enherts for caring for him ü•∞ #StaySafe #StayHomeSaveLives #NHSThankYou #NHSheroes
3521,"3 kind reception experiences - I'm having breast cancer treatment, currently chemo, at St bartholemews & my next one is tomorrow. Wanted to flag up & say thanks for 3 acts of kindness. First, yesterday I got to ECG clinic 3 too late from my pre chemo appointment and the receptionist and other staff were so kind and said they'd have my details ready for today and to come in at a good time for me. They were true to their word. Then an understanding call handler in central appts understood why I would not feel able to go in person to dermatology at the London on Monday and emailed the team for me, explaining about my chemo and finally I went round to the imaging clinic and a 3rd very understanding receptionist helped move a CT scan to a date further away from my chemo. Thank you all."
2078,"Womens outpatients Grantham hospital - The staff I met during my appointment were professional & caring taking time to explain my health issues, risks and potential further treatment. They effecrively explained the brief procedure and provided reassurance during it. The service was punctual and facilities clean. Could not have had a better experience. Thank you"
816,I RESPECT THE NHS SO MUCH IM SORRY THEY HAVE SAVED BOTH OF MY PARENTS LIFES MORE THAN ONCE ü•∫ I AM SO THANKFUL @NHSuk @enherts
4924,After arriving in the gynaecology department and having a piece of paper shoved on the desk in front of me I was feeling extremely anxious as I was unsure what it was for. 
1246,"EAU: in a very uncomfortable and rapid atrial tachycardia. Clinical management was ok, but a complete absence of 'care'. I 'slept' on a rock hard mattress having constant rapid uncomfortable palpitations. (You should try what that feels like), made worse by a 'shortage of pillows'! By the open window I was cold with a pathetic excuse for a 'blanket'. Cannula in my occipital fossa & ECG leads made it difficult to move. No help offered. No thought. Kept awake by a drug addict and admitted pts being asked to repeat questions already answered in ED. A totally inappropriate environment for a cardiac patient."
5586,Don't know - Great service in the endoscopy dept. - I was called for a colonoscopy following bowel screening and was quiet nervous. Firstly I had a very informative phone consultation with the screening nurses and an appointment for the actual procedure the following Friday. On arrival at the department I was greeted and was asked to take a seat. A few minutes later I was collected by a lovely nurse and checked in. I didn't have to wait long to be taken in for my procedure and was put at ease by the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. Everyone introduced themselves and continued to chat to me and check I was ok throughout. Everything they were doing was explained to me before it was done and I was well looked after throughout my visit. I have to say that should I require a repeat check in future I will not be as nervous thanks to the wonderful staff I met today. 
7245,I was not expecting to be able to have tests done that day. It greatly reduced worry waiting for a date for a test. Transport to the hospital is not always ideal so limiting visit to one was ideal.
7165,"Shocking - I've been under mental health for over half of my life. Always seen by this place, always parred off and pushed away. I'm 18 now. I would've been about 10 when I was first referred. Time and time again to sit in a room with someone to ask awful personal questions. To not help at all and par me off to another organisation that can help me even less. Just to be sent back to do it all again. One of the most awful experiences of my life and I've lost count how many times I've had to do it! How dare any of you sit there and claim you help people, not only that you're meant to be helping children! I'm angry and disgusted at the fact I know I'm not the only one. And other kids will grow up trying to battle through the same system. Confused and wondering why them. Why no one could be bothered to help. Then fighting even more to get help the older you get. You should all be ashamed of yourselves and I hope at least one person feels guilt reading this. Because there's a lot of you. "
7887,all as expected no fuss all correct and easy

9202,Plastic surgery - Yet another cancelled appointment - Operated on for skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) in August 2019. Review set for November 2019. Three cancellation later and it will be over six months since the operation. This is not the only cancellation as the dermatology department have also cancelled three times for reviews after treatment. Just about given up with Castle Hill.
2242,The staff and doctors were very good very attentive and kind made my stay easier and I was not so nervous so they were fantastic big Thankyou

I could not rate the quality of care I have received during and after my birth highly enough. everyone was so friendly and helpful, including the cleaners and the porters. the student midwives were also wonderful. I am so grateful for everyone's care and can't thank you or recommend you enough as a service provider. keep doing the amazing job you do! Special thank you to my community midwife, Rachel, for seeing me through this pregnancy."
3868,We bloody love you @NHSuk @BasildonHosp On top of everything else the nurses have to do and in the middle of a massive health crisis they still make time to sit with my dad to do FaceTime calls with us. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è #NHSHeroes
6175,You've all been brilliant thankyou
6798,very rude staff ... my jacket and wallet was stolen from inside the R clinic and head nurse started blaming me raising her voice with her colleagues. i was severely injured walking with crutches and they took off my jacket whilst examining. after missing my jacket they didn't even apologised or showed sympathy. instead they started being rude with nasty comments. disgraceful
3746,I wen't down to Brune Medical Center least week for a check up for my son and got weighed and she said he weighs 8 pounds but she was wrong he doesn't actually weigh that so now I'm going to get them done don't waste your time with them.
3341,"Accident and emergency services - Helpful and personable - Thank you to the A&E staff at West Midd who helped my child when they developed Type 1 Diabetes. They were supportive, helpful, reassuring and open with us. They were professional and personable, and organised admission quickly. They really helped make this experience more bearable and manageable. "

6088,
8300,Urology - Kidney / Bladder Stone Operation - Once again I have been lucky to be given the excellent care and attention from the Royal United Hospital. I was admitted on 30th September for an operation. I would like to thank the Admission Suite B32 for their efficiency. I particularly wish to thank the surgeon and his team for the brilliant operation they carried out. I wish to thank him for visiting the ward in the evening and updating me on the procedure he had carried out. The staff in Robin Smith Ward were brilliant in the care they gave me and in teaching me how to use a catheter. I am very lucky to have such good medical care in my area. Very Best Wishes to you all. Mr Raymond Peter Palmer 
2463,Excellent. Everyone here is always excellent!
971,"These 2 really are heroes. Mum's wish has always been to pass away at home, surrounded by her family. @Ldn_Ambulance Tam & Luke would not leave mum until all necessary agencies were on board & she now has what she needs to make her comfortable & peaceful at home. Thank you üôè"
8538,"I have just spent the last week oa Greetwell Ward and I honestly say at the start I really didn't wish to come into hospital but what I didn't realise what a, 'treat' I was in for. The staff at all level from the cleaner to ward matron I cannot fault. Even when getting stress off patients they dealt with dignity and respect. I came in with one condition but sorry as you had to learn how to deal the the seizure quickly and how to keep yourselves plus me safe. You are the first ward I have been on where that feeling came very quickly. Some wards I never settle on and when that occurs it becomes a negative experience and something I feel anxious about therefore my other condition gets so bad (I know, you would not had wanted more to deal with.) But a big thank you to everyone. I would love this to be read out by the matron as sometimes it's nice to get positive feedback. Debs4234"
657,"Today is OB Jnr Mk1's birthday (Morning Skip, enjoy the cake üòâ). The best April Fool's stunt pulled on me by the OH whose waters broke at 00.30, 5 weeks prem and breech. My heartfelt thanks, as ever, to the SCBU @UHSFT for their fantastic work especially all the tea and biccies."
9911,"Diagnostic Endoscopy - Couldn't ask for more - I attended for an endoscopy procedure. I was very anxious following a prior traumatic medical experience and was unsure I could go through with it. All four of the doctors and nurses who were involved in the procedure were so kind, patient and understanding. They completely reassured me and the procedure itself was no problem at all. I am very grateful to them for giving me such a positive experience."
1586,"Under rated service- really effective therapy - I have completed CBT therapy before for depression and anxiety. But this time round has been really outstanding. The member of staff was really understanding and informative - shared a lot of knowledge when it came to my condition and ways to challenge my behaviour and thoughts. By doing the booklet exercises it allowed me to analyse myself each session to see where I could improve on. You have to put in the effort in order to get results ( this means doing some homework). His effort levels and dedication was unmatched and I am truly thankful for this service and that it is free. The only thing I wish, was if the sessions were a little bit longer. Other than that I couldn't recommend it enough."
5641,It would be nice to not text my phone about something that i haven't requested. FIY I am allergic to poison and bs ok. Other than that its a lovely GP only given 1 star due to these annoying texts o have been getting.

7393,"I couldn't have asked for more. The antenatal care was thorough and personal to me, and I got the birth I wanted in the birthing centre. Postpartum care was also amazing with daily house calls to help establish breastfeeding. I felt supported and listened to throughout, thank you to the team at Wythenshawe"
1240,One of the worst experience. I was waiting for ambulance for over 1h so I decide to go by my self to this hospital. Friend of mine helped me to take my dad to the car because he wasnt able to walk. Infront of the hospital Ive seend 4 Amb7lance doimg nothing even one of the driver said that he hasnt atroke. OMG! His face changed. 2nd time the same thing! But the 1st one wasnt here in UK! My dad waiting with potential 2nd stroke infront of the urgent centre 4ight now and o one send him to the emergency to chekck his blood preasure or any kind of examinations! This is so sad! Paying all his life insurance and taxes! 
5247,"Maternity services - Lack of compassion, lack of information - I came in for an early pregnancy scan on Monday. I already knew it was a failed pregnancy, my second one in six months. I found it upsetting that my midwife spoke to me as though I should be used to it. Of course it's a routine, ordinary thing for her but she spoke as if it was a routine, ordinary thing for me. Perhaps this was her way of making it feel less monumental, less overwhelming? But it felt less sympathetic, less compassionate. With each pregnancy loss it gets harder, not easier. Surely she's aware of this. Upon looking at the scan she said she could see that the pregnancy would miscarry naturally, but she did inform me of my other options. I said no to the surgery but was interested in medical management. I asked what was involved in this process and she said: ‚Äúwe give you the pills here and then you go home. Within 4-8 hours you will miscarry, at which point there will be heavy bleeding and some cramping.‚Äù Based on this information, I chose this option. In total I waited an hour, during which time it was revealed to me in pieces that actually I would need to give a blood sample and await the results, actually I would need to wait for a doctor and that these were not pills that I could swallow but that he would need to insert vaginally, and that I would have to stay afterwards for observation. I understand that these procedures are necessary and that waiting times are unavoidable, but I specifically asked what to expect and all of this crucial information was omitted from the response. I was keen to avoid anything invasive. I was also feeling upset, vulnerable and alone, and so was desperate to get home to my family. I left without receiving the treatment I wanted because I was distressed, because I saw no clear end to the length of time I would have to stay, and because I felt very let down. Now, a week later, I still haven't miscarried and am living with the most awful waiting game: I'm still pregnant, dreading the prospect of suddenly bleeding it out at work or in public, not knowing how heavy or painful it will be or when it will strike. Miscarriage is never a choice but I feel that the little agency I had over the situation was removed almost as soon as it was offered to me. "
4346,I was seen very quickly and everyone I spoke to was kind and helpful.
6613,Once again massive thanks to all the wonderful @NHS staff at @barnshospital. You really are remarkable people. Special thanks to staff on ward 22 who have cared for my mum and put her on the path to recovery. https://t.co/2kwK771ruI
1656,"We cannot thank Daniel Tweedie enough for the pure professionalism courteous and caring approach he provided to our daughter pre; during and post her procedure carried out. From the first consultation to the after care provided, nothing was of any trouble in alleviating any concerns we may have had. A Thoroughly experienced Children's Consultant who we would highly recommend, and a credit to his profession. Thank you Dr Tweedie and to all the staff at the Portland Hospital. Will never be forgotten for everything."

3532,Sitting out side in the car park outside Guildford Diagnostic Imaging watching two pigeons pecking the leaves and a rat ran past. Right in the middle of a Hospital complex! 
1292,"Been In here twice recently after a heart attack and for me the care was fantastic, I was let down badly by GP failing to investigate my complaints for 7 years and it was a close call but my care from here 10 out of 10 thankyou."
5547,Services being scaled down - I recently had day surgery at Grantham hospital and it's a shame services there are being scaled down yet the population continues to grow annually as evidenced by increasing housing projects and referrals to other hospitals for admissions / care. Hope services can be fully reinstated or another hospital built within the area to provide the care we require.
4085,"Breast cancer services - Reply to text request for feedback - I would have preferred not to leave a public review, but I have been trying for days to work out how to send this as a text from Tesco mobile, replying to a feedback request from the hospital, my phone blocks me replying unless I change my settings because it's a premium text number, and I think I have to ring my provider for this because I can't do it online, even though I don't believe you get charged my mobile provider thinks I will. So here is my reply to a text request for feedback after I visited for a mammogram. When you check in at the desk you are told to remove your mask that you arrived with, go into a tiny toilet cubicle (door propped open), wash your hands then come out and put on a new mask from a box of masks. This made me very anxious and cross. Everyone removes their mask before entering a tiny room where they breathe without a mask on. Isn't this why we wear masks to avoid breathing other people's breath! ? Then you assume everyone washed their hands well enough that they are clean when they turn the tap off. Then you take an unwrapped mask from a box where it is impossible not to touch the mask below and the elastics are a little tangled. Then you put the mask on. This felt far, far less hygienic than leaving your home mask on. If this needs to happen you need a more open wash station and the masks need to be separated or at least higher so you don't breathe on them whilst you try to get one out. I also never wear masks that go round my ears because I have eczema there. After that, presumably for hygiene, prior to your mammogram you have to remove your clothes, not in private but standing in the middle of the room where the mammogram takes place, which is not great. I also wish it was quicker than 3 weeks to wait for the results but that is separate from the visit. "
1053,"Absolutely disappointed my mum is so ill, no feed back, no call back from amy consultant after time after time call secretary No empathy with the fact in current climate we as family have no information"

7109,"So had a Coronectomy done at Russell's hall three weeks ago. Firstly my ‚Äúdissolvable stitches‚Äù don't dissolve. Secondly I end up with a dry socket and a concerning red lump I thought to be an abscess developing on the other side to which they say ‚Äúno reason to be concerned, no antibiotics or packing required‚Äù. I did also question their negligence at this stage. My dentist (who was concerned at the hospitals response) then packs the dry socket (a dry socket caused by failed stitching) to prevent further infection and prescribes more antibiotics on Tuesday. Thirdly, I notice a progressive numbness and tingley pain spreading across the side I had a concerning red lump. Tonight I look, and what do I find? A nice burst abscess. Thank you yet again for surgery that has caused more problems than its purpose, and your negligent post care. No wonder NHS Dudley group are being constantly investigated for negligence when this is how people are treated. This was rejected to be published on NHS website so always check these reviews first for honest reviews"
8555,"Got there 5 minutes before appointment at 11, Offered hand sanitizer on way in, limited seating and social distancing, seat wiped down after use, went in to see consultant at 11.05, he told me everything about my up coming procedure on my knee, I left his office with total confidence, and on leaving the unit was offered hand sanitizer again, easy to park.All round great experience."
9065,"Hello, I do not recommend this service for anyone that is bereaved, I lost my soul mate of 15 years 2 years ago and we had only been in Lowestoft since 2016 as we moved from London where we had always lived. I rang my GP and said that because of Covid-19 the spiritualist churches have been shut where I was getting a lot of help and I had one bad week most of the time I am o.k. so he referred me to the Wellbeing service I also told him that I was bereaved, I got a phone call from a young woman who is supposed to be assessing you for 45 minutes, 45 minutes of asking a bereaved 59 year old woman disgusting questions like 'do you feel like harming yourself or anyone else' and earlier on in the conversation I told her I have cats which I love and she said 'do you feel like harming your cats' I already told her I was bereaved, and also she said 'you can call the police if you want' what for? I'm 60 in 8 months time, this service has got nothing to do with bereaved people suffering from grief and loss, I was so drained after being asked evil questions for 45 minutes that I fell asleep for 4 hours - it just physically drained me and I have never come across such evil questions to a kind loving woman that cared for her partner for 7 years as he was ill with heart problems and then got rapid progressive motor neuron disease and all I ever did was love him. Please do not use this service if you are a kind loving person they make you feel like hell. I have gone on Facebook and joined Bereavement groups, I rang the Wellbeing service and told them I am going privately because I can afford to. There are plenty of kind people on Facebook that help."

3838,"Neurology - Understanding Registrar - I had to attend the Hallamshire Neurology Department for investigation in January and was fortunate to be put in the care of a wonderful Registrar. So many times previously I had been rushed through GPs and hospital appointments, feeling frustrated and leaving without answers but this time the Registrar took time to thoroughly investigate me, approached me with respect and understanding and took on board my concerns and questions. There is a heap of difference between hearing and really listening and I felt he really listened. I had chance to ask questions and he put my mind at rest. Added to that I was given a variety of solutions to think about, something, I hadn't had before. I was really thankful to be given the time and respect and my condition not dismissed, especially during this immensely busy time for health care professionals. The nurses on the ward and during blood testing were also lovely and supportive despite all the pressures they were under. On the whole this was a very positive experience"
4645,"Very helpful and a very efficient service - I have COPD also have 2 disabled sons who have to have some one with them, The staff were so helpful they got a wheelchair for me as I couldn't cope with the walk they found a parking space so my husband could park by the exit both times I had my appointment and out in minutes with the minimum of fuss well done NHS you are a fab organisation."

Invitation letter clearly stated I should be accompanied to hear the results of the investigation but wife was refused entry due to COVID restrictions. This is a very annoying failure of the organisation. We were unable to find a parking place on site and had to park elsewhere, walk back and nearly missed appointment time."
899,Thank you for taking care of my mum for the last two weeks. 
5371,Sympathised with lady @BBCRadio4 @EvanHD on #pm earlier saying her mum was left on bed for 24 hours without going to a ward. My mum went to @uhbtrust Heartlands on Monday 2pm and was on a wheelchair overnight until released nearly 24 hours later?! ? Others 2. Had to ask 4 a drink! 
7807,"Maternity services - Two days in maternity day assessment - My wife and I spent Sunday and Monday for most parts of each day within the maternity day assessment due to some complications with baby, and the service we received from the midwife on duty both days as she was the same person was absolutely incredible, responsive, caring, attention to detail was impeccable. Not only was she extremely busy, whenever she was consulting with ourselves, she never rushed anything, she was calm collected and spot on. What I really appreciate as the husband, was that she took the time to consult with me and explain things to both of us and not just my pregnant wife. The midwife is an absolute asset to WSH, and I hope she inspires many more midwifes to deliver the same quality of care. Thank you very much! "

8608,Intensive Care - One life saved - I was brought by ambulance on March 16th and taken straight to resus . I was quickly diagnosed with acute kidney injury stage 3 and needed haemofiltration in critical care . I was then diagnosed with strep a igas an invasive infection .I spent a week on critical care and then went to the wards I developed pneumonia and empyema and In total I was in hospital for 4 weeks . The care I received was excellent and all in a time at the start of the pandemic .

8147,"Reaction to covid vaccine - I had covid vaccine a few days ago, and had quite a bad reaction for longer than usual. I spoke to a private GP first, who advised me to go to A&E, but as I felt too unwell for the journey I decided to phone 111 to see if I absolutely had to or not. It was arranged for a paramedic clinician to call me back, and this brilliant lady was on the phone to me for 40 minutes, checking all my symptoms etc. I was extremely reluctant to go to A&E as my local hospital has no understanding of my health condition, and they always throw me out at the soonest opportunity, but this kind paramedic was insistent that my reaction was a very rare occurrence that did need urgent care. She also said I should go straight to A&E, so my husband took me, & we spent the night there. As I needed to be in a wheelchair, they did at least let him in too. I had various tests, & then saw an A&E doctor. She asked why we were there, and asked what long covid is, she told me I wasn't having a bad reaction to the vaccine, it must be something else. I wish the lovely paramedic I'd spoken to at home had been there at that moment, she would have been furious with that doctor. The same old story - no one wants to take any responsibility for anything. She said my dizziness was likely to be because of drinking alcohol - I don't drink alcohol as I can't tolerate it, but she appeared totally convinced that's what the problem was. There was absolutely no attempt to do anything to try and relieve any symptoms - I do not understand how this hospital operates safely. I asked for morphine as my pain levels were very high, but she wouldn't give me any (even to get home on) because morphine isn't for dizziness. I said I needed it for the pain, but she said I hadn't presented with pain - I said that actually I had, so please could she give me some, but she was completely unmoved. There was absolutely no way I could communicate with the 'robots' at this hospital's A&E department, they barely acted human, without trying to sound rude. I am yet again just a number, and I got no help whatsoever, in fact it made all my symptoms worse - as per the norm. It always seems to be my fault that I'm there. Last time I went there I vowed never to go back - now I know why I made that vow. How can the place be safe? I found it in no way fit for purpose. How can you run an A&E department with doctors who demonstrated to me so little medical knowledge? It is beyond me to even begin to understand it, and it is pretty frightening. If that's all the care every patient gets then I am appalled beyond words."
1522,"If you are looking for an additional stress, then choose this hospital. As a private patients, we spoke most of the time to the answer machine. Nurses never called back. Appointments were cancelled one after another without giving any explanation. To arrange next appointment I had to spent all day calling private patient department and any random numbers I could find. Anyone who is having treatment in this hospital, I am wishing you all the best"

2693,I had my baby boy on 26th August 2019. After being transferred from the birthing suite to the labour ward due to my blood pressure I was looked after by two amazing midwives. The first was Amanda and then Emma took over. Emma was supposed to finish her shift at 16.30 that day and stayed with me until my son was born at 18.18 she was just the loveliest lady. Both midwives come to see me in recovery after. Thank you ladies you're both very special and do a wonderful job. Baby Charlie was lucky to be in your capable hands

I was located on the AMU unit 2 and was admitted due to a rare hereditary condition namely Accute Intermittent Porphyra I have since my diagnosis in 2000 unfortunately had to stay in various hospitals during this period. I can state now without any doubt that the Royal Cornwall Hospital and her staff are the best by far and they should all be commended on their hardwork and dedication. Thankyou again and keep up the brilliant work. Kind regards, Paul Child"

3401,"Be warned the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth has very dirty kitchen facilities and if you're a patient, they do not tell you all the charges! I asked how much the consultation would cost and was told 220, then in addition got a bill for a further 165 for the room and use of the ECG machine in the room. I was also charged for blood tests I never even received when I attended for an operation! Stay away! "

2123,"Excellent Care - Strangely, during the pandemic, it seems better than ever. The waiting times in A&E were only a hour, which is even more amazing when they saw about ten people in that time, and every is a one-way system, socially distanced, and very clean. All of the staff were so friendly, professional, and very polite; I felt very comfortable and safe during my whole time there. The only thing I'd say is that there needs to be some access to water, as the vending machine is still broken, and you can be there a good few hours in total. Overall, the hospital A&E has never been better. "

8892,"Caring, professional surgery - February 2020, I was admitted to Harrogate hospital through a / e, with a fractured pelvis, staying there one week. I was discharged with a few days pain relief. I wrote a covering letter, requesting a further weeks supply of pain relief medication. As I am immobile, I asked a friend to deliver my letter. This request I followed up the following day, as I was running out of morphine. The lady I spoke to, listened carefully to me and said that she was going to search for my letter. She phoned me back a little while later, she had found my letter and placed it in the duty doctors emergency tray. The next morning this wonderful lady phoned me at 8.05am, inquiring if I had received my pain relief, I explained that I hadn't. She then followed this up with further investigations, phoned me back within half an hour, explaining that the prescription was with the pharmacist and would be ready for collection very soon. I felt this lady went way beyond her job description, the fact that she phoned me the following morning, I thought was amazing, incredible and extremely caring. I have been a patient of this surgery for about nine years now, I have always found the staff extremely caring and professional. The doctors come out for you, always with a smile, I never feel rushed, I always feel they listen carefully and respond appropriately. The reception area is welcoming and clean, the staff are delightful and they listen to you, responding appropriately. I have never had to wait too long for an appointment, and in the case of an emergency, you are dealt with quickly. I feel truly blessed to belong to such a caring, professional practice, thank you so very much to everyone at Kingswood surgery, I am truly grateful to you all. "
8123,Its always nightmare experiences at St Georges Hospital to many works getting paid but all they seems chatting not muck work doing it seems all the tax people are paying goes mostly waste
5433,"Maternity services - Disappointing quality of care - My husband and I are expecting our first child soon and at 37 weeks found out the baby was breeched. This discovery quickly led to two different Obstetricians telling me that I needed to schedule a caesarean. Knowing that there are numerous other options, I found this very bias and frustrating. Shortly after, we transferred to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and were put in touch with their breech team. Our baby was successfully flipped during an ECV one week later. I completely understand that St. Mary's may not be equipped to handle this but then state that and make a referral. Jumping straight to major surgery is not in the best interest of the baby or the mother. Very disappointing level of care. "
2439,"Accident and emergency services - Thank you for all your help - Dear Sir / Madam, On Saturday 17th October after a sudden and strangely unique event (for me), that my mother would have called ‚Äúa funny turn, ‚Äù which occurred without warning around lunchtime at my house, I was subsequently advised by a Crewe Optician to take my condition to the A and E which I duly did. Not having experienced severe double vision and the disorientation before and fearing the worst I was treated very promptly; quicker than I expected, by the teams in A and E. Thank you. From the initial triage by the nurse, examination by the duty doctor and also her superior, from the lady who escorted me to the CT scan, and also the CT scanning team everything was all joined up, quick and very professional. Thank you. Once I had been given the all clear and allowed back into the community, the members of staff melted away; as I guess they always do, moving onto their next cases and I did not really have the opportunity to express my thanks to all who participated in my minor (to them I'm sure) `patient event`. May I therefore ask you to pass on my thanks to them all ‚Äì and also to the senior team across the piece because in my experience efficient and effective staff and departments are a product of a joined up senior management team and a structured management environment within which staff are enabled to give of their best, day to day. Thank you. With my very best wishes, Paul Wharton"
5828,Extremely happy helpful staff. Clearly enjoy being there. Very efficient process of being seen and treated. Very impressed. Thank you.

4914,Disgusting place.
1698,Ive marked it a one I was very happy with my visit
148,"Had to go into pregnancy triage. Luckily husband was allowed in with me on this occasion as I was really nervous. Nurses and doctors were lovely and reassuring. However, I had to wait unnecessarily for few hours in the waiting area because they didn't know where I was, I wasn't told that I should wait in the consultation room. This was my 1st trip to Triage. Also, all women should be allowed to bring one partner in with them to triage regardless. Being pregnant is stressful enough, but having anxiety of visiting hospital is stressful too for women. Home testing covid kits have been made for a reason, but Birmingham Women's are not taking good advantage of them. Triage needs to think about a women's emotional health too by putting a practical policy of letting support partner come in. NHS boasts about Mental health but are lacking in support practically. Its been over a year with this pandemic and we will have to live with it, but a women's emotional health and anxiety is important too."
4948,"Could not access the video link appointment, but the consultant rang me. Very much appreciated, thank you."

8268,"Don't know - EXCELLENT CARING & KIND STAFF - Have addenbrooks hospital regularly but due to covid my appointment was changed to here which was better for me. I've never used saffron walden community hospital before.. As I walked thru carpark a nurse was leaving and smiled, found my department (ultrasound) and the reception person was friendly and welcoming.. While waiting the x-ray person even said hello and we won't be long, then I was called in for doppler and again the person doing this was so kind friendly and caring (I'm recovering from stroke had in January). All so caring, friendly and polite. On feeling safe due to covid, the hospital was spotless, everyone that's staff and public was wearing masks and there's hand sanitiser everywhere. Safety was first class. On leaving the hospital 2 nurses smiled in car park, this is such a excellent hospital with kind and caring staff, such a lovely atmosphere. Not only would I be more than happy to recommend to friends and family but anyone like me worried about going due to the covid, please don't worry, there is nothing to worry about. It's only my 2nd outing since March as on shielded group. This really is a fantastic hospital with excellent staff who are extremely friendly. Lastly but most importantly thank you to EVERY NHS worker for your hard work and caring nature keeping us all safe and well throughout this awful covid time Thank you!! "

7196,Rang the switchboard service with an urgent medical query to see if I could take my gf for an out of hours GP appointment at half 1 in the morning (she had a sudden rash causing extreme pain). Got through straight away but before I could even explain that this was my question I was extremely rudely told speak to 111 (who I was already on hold to for over 20 minutes). I question what on Earth this woman's actual job is other than just simply diverting responsibility to 111.

The course was very informative and the midwife running it was fantastic. She was knowledgeable and engaging and the online format worked really well. We were worried the 2.5 hour sessions would feel like a long time but they flew by! Thanks so much to the maternity team for providing this support during a difficult time, we now feel so much more prepared for what is to come."
3272,Mr Tweedie carried out an adenotonsillectomy on our 2.5 year old son in December 2019 with great success. Mr Tweedie was wonderful from start to finish and provided us with clear advice and facts about the operation and the recovery. The operation was straightforward and my son was happily eating a banana within an hour of the end of the operation and ceased taking painkillers within 5 days post-operation. He made a very quick recovery with no bleeding and no complications. My son's sleep apnea and his very loud snoring stopped immediately after the operation and my son is now like a different child - so much more energy. A huge thank you to Mr Tweedie - you have made such a tremendous difference to our little boy's health and happiness.

3236,Some Staff are helpful others are a waste of space and rude and moody. Social distancing is in effect unless you use the lift then your squashed in by staff!! Had to cancel an appointment due to the fact they put my daughters two scans too close together we couldn't make the one scan at all on time. Not a pleasant experience at all stressed out with a disabled young adult and won't be back in a hurry once a year is enough.

I have to say I've never had such an incredible team of staff / calm experience before. The whole procedure, start to finish was worry free, I felt the staff were going above and beyond to not only follow hygiene rules but to also enable me to feel as calm and safe as possible. They took the time to listen to my concerns and took even more time to reassurance me / make sure all those worries disappeared. An endoscopy was something that I was dreading having but they made me feel so calm and safe, so much so I wouldn't be scared if I had to have antoher.

To see a Dr who made it clear he felt O was wasting his time and gave me dismissive answers to my questions. Told me I have 3onths, but not if that was from end of November when when Nurse broke news to me of Terminal cancer or his mid Jan glance at me. Ignored my question on what my end of life expectations should be. Offerd palative care, but once I told him I had this covered he dismissed me. Total waste of my day and only made me feel worse."

6376,"12 months ago, in the early hours of the morning I had to be resuscitated in @MFT_MRI after an Op, I can not thank everyone who helped me recover, but @JadeField85 (and the Nurses) saved my life, and my mind. The world now looks brighter in the morning. #NHS thank you"
8402,"Dr Bennett Briton is the best doctor at the practice, he is old school in a young man. Gets the one medical issue you have come about on that visit - as the surgery states one medical problem only - completed in a polite, professional caring and understanding way. Wish there were more Dr Bennett Britons out there, but im afraid they only reside in Mayfair or Harley Street! "
9646,1st in and last to be seen I understand the priority however when does this end. I havnt eaten or drank in over 18 hours and exained this to staff wheb coming to a&e and because i am chair bpund cannot do anything about it. Nor can i get assistance yo go to the loo. Very dismissive staff. With no naturally caring personalities. wish i had gone to kingston hospal and put myself through the pain of doing that than risk ever coming here again! HORRIFIC. noth8ng to do with pandemic but im sure itll be used as an excuse. Although i need a x-ray not ventilator. But there we go
8858,"The sheer quality of your staff. They have been excellent, dealing with me, a patient that was frequently being frightened."
4533,"I had a colonoscopy today in the Jasmine Ward at Newham General Hospital. Nurses excellent and caring. Doctor Kulhalli explained everything prior to starting procedure & was very professional. I find having a colonoscopy really uncomfortable. So, I appreciated the medical teams efforts to try and put me at ease. Tea, Toast and Apricot Jam after the procedure made a nice change to the usual tea and biscuits."
8639,"Orthopaedics - Very greatful - I Would like to thank the surgeons, theatre staff and all working staff of ward 28 for my care pre, during and after my hip operation. You are all wonderful. So caring and professional. The only negative I had of my experience is that I couldn't sleep for the noise on an evening, which wasn't totally the staffs fault. They have a job to do. I hope I was a respectable patient in your eyes. I know how hard it can be to care for someone who is grumpy because they are in pain. "
6608,Very efficient. I was seen quickly with minimal wait. Polite and friendly staff. I wasnt hurried despite being the last appointment of the day.Improvements: I didnt see anyone cleaning the waiting room chairs in between people sitting on them. With Covid this should be done. Directions for visitor parking from the road are not easy to follow.
1658,very helpful staff thank you so much
3253,#NationalVolunteersWeek Maggie volunteered to walk visually impaired Bill and Senthu around our Eye to Eye walk in March.

3249,All the staff have been very friendly. | Nothing at all
8383,"I was told about a new issue which explains why Ive been feeling unwell recently. I felt Dr. covered all the aspects of my diabetic care thoroughly. She also told me about an app I can use to help me manage my condition better, which I will be using. Dr. was friendly and encouraging. It was a very helpful consultation indeed."

3084,"My little boy PERSON born at 31 weeks was on neonatal for just under 6 weeks. It was such an emotional time and the hardest thing to leave your baby and go home, but the nurses and staff on this unit are absolutely amazing and in these circumstances couldn't have made me and my partner feel more confident and comfortable about our little boys care. Especially PERSON, PERSON and PERSON you were all amazing.. He's now home and is doing amazingly well. . Thank you from us all ‚ù§Ô∏è"
6478,"I have been waiting 2 weeks for an appointment for an injection in my knee was told they would be in touch by today but no, told it is routine and will happen sometime. How can severe knee pain 24/7 be routine. I am trying to stay in work as a NHS key worker but it gets harder everyday when I can barely walk."
5102,"The consultant and his assistant were both really, really kind and considerate. It is always an embarrassing consultation but they treated me with respect and answered all my questions. Cottage hospitals are such a wonderful way of looking after us. I was very glad to be referred there."
7858,"Very effective check at Covid reception. Friendly and cheerful receptionists at main A&E reception that managed to make me smile even when in pain , a rare talent and appreciated! Short wait of 30 mins in spotlessly clean waiting area. Triage was fine but maybe too connected to waiting area so patients chat was not private as conversation could be heard in waiting area. Seen by doctor again very good care. X rayed very quickly. Radiographer was mindful of my pain and tried hard to be quick with x rays and allowed me to sit when feeling faint. Results of X-ray were again very quick and arm strapped and"
2180,"My stay here was mixed, the very long wait in A&E without food was challenging - uncomfortable but the staff were kind and polite. After 7 hours I eventually was given a bed but had no sleep. The ward staff were amazing and such sympathetic doctors. I went home feeling very relieved that all my tests were good. Thank you NHS."
5510,Perfect team and excellent.
6131,OK there is a lift hard to find toilets
4223,Disfunctional collection of services that show years of mismanagement. | Only way to restore nhs to its original world number one rank is to run it centrally ie by the government.
2318,So my 78 Yr old Dad with @ParkinsonsUK has been shoved in #blandfordhospital 40 mins from home cause @PHCharity palmed him off. Still hasn't seen #Parkinsons nurse in over 3 weeks. Sat in a chair all weekend. I was told its rehabilitation.
4082,A recent admission - Due to a reaction to medication I was left unable to communicate as I would usually do. And unable to walk without help and jerking limbs. There are some truly wonderful staff that work on that ward. As a nurse myself the small acts of kindness and care received will stay with me forever. There was a young male nurse who managed to understand that I wanted to go to the toilet. He stopped what he was doing held my hand and walked me to the toilet. That act of kindness meant the absolute world to me. There was only one member letting the team down and they were one of the staff that provide tea / coffee.They just needs to think about what they say to people who have problems communicating. There are some not so nice people / patients on the ward who were rude and telling mis truths and the staff dealt with these.
8763,Score could have been 1 but the clinic was running 30 minutes late.
3331,"I recently had my baby girl at this hospital, and would like say how amazing I have found whole experience, I couldn't fault any of the service provided, the staff have been truly helpful and couldn't assist you more, overall I definitely recommend this hospital."
441,"Don't know - Great services, but phlebotomy wait times! - Its not the staffs fault, but the wait to have blood taken is crazy. I arrived at 11.25 Weds 2/9/20, was given a number in the queue. I left the hospital at 2.30, after a blood test that only took about 4 minutes. The rest of the time was waiting, first outside, then called into the waiting room. This was the third time I had attempted to get this done, the first time I couldn't wait that long. The second time they had closed early due to the volume of patients. Today I just sat it out. The staff were excellent. When it got near lunchtime we were told that the wait was about to increase because of staff lunchtime, which left one member of staff taking bloods instead of two. Soon after it appeared that they closed the clinic early again to stop any more patients coming in. Why on earth are more staff not employed to do this job? There is so much space at this hospital, they could triple the phlebotomy staff there. OR even better, take blood testing back to GP surgeries like it used to be. "
1066,Accident and emergency services - Unnecessarily slow! - Unbelievably slow moving doctor in the children's a&e department. One of the nurses asked him if she could go and find another doctor to help him out and he said NO! In 2 hours he saw 2 patients. There was no sense of urgency with him. He was taking his time because he clocked off at 12. He sat at his computer slowly tapping away. Looking at his phone and then ran out bang on 12 as if he works at Boots. So many children waiting just to be discharged by him which would have taken him 5 mins each. We then had to wait another hour for another doctor from another department. He could have accepted the offer from the nurse to get this doctor hours earlier. We all understand we must be seen in turn. But the snails pace of him was deliberate and it was obvious. None of the cases were life threatening and all could have been in and out very quickly. It's all a figure fiddling exercise. If your wait time is still green they won't see you until it goes yellow or red. Then they complete their work when your wait time goes black. This is not putting patients first. This is nhs politics!! A disgusting this to do in children's a&e! To make matters worse the nurse gave no update the entire time. She took a urine sample and 2 hours later didn't have the decency to at least let us know it was clear. She had plenty of time on her hands as the doctor was going so slowly there was nothing for her to do. She chatted away with her fellow nurses and ignored everyone. Simple updates like letting people know what's happening would have been helpful. Tell people that their kids urine test is clear and you are now waiting to see the doctor. Don't leave us for 3 hours without speaking a word to us when we are only 3 foot away from you! 
2352,"I can not begin to praise this amazing hospital and their wonderful staff. Nothing was too much for them, all the staff from porters - doctors - nurses - health care assistants. Thank You for looking after me again."
1096,"No complaints about the care, but 21 minutes parking on Friday at PRH cost 3.50. 21 minutes in the short stay car park at Heathrow Airport, one of the most expensive places to park in the UK costs 3.60."

6790,"A big Thankyou to the staff. My daughter has Special Needs and doesn't cope well in busy environments. Unfortunately she needed to attend today and we were afforded a great deal of compassion and understanding. As someone who once worked for the NHS, I understand the pressures. You were great and made it easier, for us BOTH! "
325,Difficulty in Getting in Touch - Extremely difficult to get through to make an appointment on the telephone. Still cannot get through to anyone other than automated service telling me I'm in the queue but never seeming to get further down the queue. I was never advised of the amalgamation of practices within the Centre. Still trying to get through.
424,"Professional, empathetic approach. The medical professional read the notes and the results of the tests beforehand and explained clearly what the next steps are in terms of appointments, correspondence and further tests. Thank you"
253,Everything was good dont need to change anything keep up the good work to you all
8592,Really is a great hospital the staff are very friendly and helpful.
3864,"Accident and emergency services - Rude staff - The lady at the reception was extremely rude, was not willing to help and was mocking service users, I work in health and social care so I get it can be stressfully but she did not put the best interest or duty of care for the service users and was awful and not professional. When asking her if we could have anything to prop my friends leg up on as he was in for being hit by a car and his hip was in agony and could not weight bare she was very snarky and told me their nothing she can do and he should just bare the pain or if I could ‚Äúunattached a chair he could you that‚Äù and started sniggering. She made me feel embarrassed for working in the NHS and complained when I came up to help my friend move to a seat as he could not weight bare. I am truly disgusted by her attitude and am considering taking this further. Workers like this is what is giving the NHS such a bad name . Other in the weighting room where also complaining about how rude she was. She only started to show me any respect when I told her I also work in health and social care but this was still little respect . She did not give a welcoming, claiming or helping atmosphere and made the whole experience worse then it needed to be. She told a guy who came in with an allergic reaction that it ‚Äúclearly was not serious‚Äù in a very mokey tone. I would not come back hear with anyone or would I suggest it because of this women Everyone Else was lovely and welcoming and such amazing people "

They wasted a decade amd half of my life trying to get a simple fix rectified, save your teeth and time and go else where and deal with compentent people. The rest of the hospital is great though."
548,Lisa was superb

4069,
18,Don't know - Disappointed with triage procedure - Sliced top of finger and couldn't stem bleeding so attended Urgent Care wearing a plastic glove to secure bandage. Clearly still bleeding as glove was 'red' waited around 90mins (and as a number of knee and ankles had gone through) before asking for a new bandage to stem blood. Left to change my temp dressing in waiting room whilst dripping onto floor (which I cleaned with a tissue). Asked for clinical waste container - not avail. Hands both have blood all over so couldn't use toilet as didn't want to touch doors / furniture. Whilst treatment was good not sure quality of infection control is up to standard (having to hold blooded bandage and glove until arriving in treatment room) or leaving a wound to continue without some early temp treatment is really good triage. 
1649,"I was seen promptly by several staff for tests, pre op and consultations. All your staff were courteous, efficient and professional. Although this is what I would generally expect it is always gratifying to experience it. Thank you."
9503,i would recommend the ambulance service usually they are all brilliant. except for last night after a paramedic failed to book my 8 month old prem baby in after she had rolled off our bed and banged her head. we was left sat in the waiting area for hours and nobody even knew we was there because they didnt do the handover! when i confronted doctors at the hospital why i was still sat waiting after numerous children was in and out being seen my daughter had no obs done or any...thing the whole time we were there waiting because they were all completely unaware we was there and had to retake our details... not to mention the paramedic was falling asleep in the back of the ambulance on the way to the hospital.... all paramedics do an amazing job but last night couldve easily been avoided if anything wouldve happened to my daughter those paramedics wouldve been held responsible! See more ‚Äî at Good Hope Hospital A&e Department.

3210,Dad's voice rang in my ears. I thought of what he'd told me that night we came from the hospital. what I pretended not to hear but heard clear as day through the barking of dogs.what I'd dwelled on since that day. what I'd tried not to think about. 'go Namjoon. you must survive.'
4233,"Just want to say to the male nurse on the emergency assessment ward, who helped me today with my dad, just sorry I didn't get his name, thank you so so much we have a district nurse coming this afternoon üôè"
8408,"This time last year I had an emergency operation. Exactly this minute. The staff at @WestHertsNHS stayed after midnight in theatre, and all night on the ward. A year on, I'm alot better than I was and you would never believe I had it. Thank you @NHS. #nhs #ilovethenhs"

4629,"Colorectal cancer services - Excellent practice - On 12022021 I attended the Colonoscopy ward, Colchester and found that from reception to leaving I was treated by the most polite and caring staff anyone could wish for. After treatment I was explained in terms I understood what was found. I would like to say a BIG THANK YOU to all staff involved."
5727,Absolutely awful staff ...10 min waiting in front desk the receptionist sees me and she ignores me and continues with her work .... then the nurse that saw me for a check up while i was telling her what the problem was she walked away ‚Ä¶
9904," Fantastic practice - Attended Tuesday 21st January having slipped in the shower, cut my head at the back, received triage from the nurse almost as soon I arrived, then treated by the paramedic who was on duty, absolutely fantastic attention by very caring nursing staff, cannot thank you all enough."
3157,"Don't know - Very Disappointed - I am a nurse who has worked in many A&Es across the country and I have the highest respect for NHS staff in general. I am so disappointed with my experience last night at Torbay on many levels. From my arrival and wait for two hours by a freezing cold door, staff talking around me like i didn't have ears, to being discharged at 3am still unwell with low blood pressure..... I have to be honest and say i will never return to Torbay again. There were a few kind staff but generally the experience was awful. I am sorry to be be blunt, but that was my experience. "
3017,"Excellent arrangements. - Given all the lock down regulations, the ability to participate in a telephone appointment meant I did not have to leave my home. This saved me a round trip of circa 50 miles for the normal appointment and all relevant health issues were adequately covered in the telephone call. "
1787,Staff Attitude
3444,Very good thank you.
3300,"A huge thank you to @WestSuffolkNHS for the exceptional care provided to our little girl who broke her arm yesterday. Thanks to the triage nurses, Gav Pymer, Ollie the Junior Doctor, Jen Bardwell, Lizzie in X-ray and Marion who helped cast her arm. @SteveDunnCEO @MyWishCharity"
4180,I can only speak from the experience of the particular hospital but the Vaccine operation at Broomfield Hospital (Chelmsford) today was very well organised and it was good to see they were very strict about ID and documentation too.
5956,the staff / nurses were always very friendly and helpful
6248,Big thank you to @TheAlexBrighton and Ward 9 for taking such good care of my little nephew and big sis this week. We are so glad he's feeling so much better thanks to your tlc. We hope you're taking care of yourselves in tough times for NHS staff. üíöüôèüèº

9100,very well organised friendly staff
699,
5134,Nice staff who made me feel safe | No
5028,"Disgusting treatment - Shocking attitude from staff, I got discharged 3 appointments in despite it being a 6 session course. If anything, I feel worse now. They don't listen nor do they care, they care more about the pay check at the end of the day than the actual kids. When I spoke about my suicide attempt the response I got was ‚Äúwell why haven't you tried again? You already know how why haven't you done it? ‚Äù. As well as this, they sent an assessment report which was full of rubbish and incredibly inaccurate things. Not to mention the 2 year wait because despite having multiple referrals they had a ‚Äúsystem error‚Äù each time I got referred. If you're looking for help there are so many more options, CAMHS is not the one. "
9176,My answer is 1 I was so well treated and looked after Thanks to all
2708,"I would really like from the management to take into consideration my review as I highly recommend and appreciate Dr Ali Abood he was very professional, patient and understanding."
4565,"Ophthalmology - Excellent Service - I recently attended an appointment at the Ophthalmology department for a checkup and was given an injection in one of my eyes. I have to say I was very impressed with the staff who were very helpful and pleasant, also the new layout of the department because of covid."
1425,Really nice Nurses was offered a soft drink Tea coffee etc.. couldn't be nicer Hospital looks clean and modern and is bright lifts avalible and there is a taxi drop off point and ample car park spaces the usual NHS car park charges apply 8/10
9630,Pharmacy available on-site - Poor service - I was the first one to give prescription. And there was no one before me in que. I have waited 55 mins as they said our waiting time is 45 mins. I can hear staff laughing and joking from window. It's so distressful that for one syrup for my son I had to wait 55 mins. Even don't know will it be improve on not but I am sure hundreds of people are wasting their time here
403,"Nice clean community hospital. It's a shame the old historical general hospital has gone, but if you have an OP appointment to come too, the staff are pleasant and the facilities are good."
4907,If there were an excellent choice I would have given it. Lovely positive receptionist - Annette Hammond (name) and an incredible caring Greeta Prashakaran (name) so helpful and gentle.

4965,Think I had to wait 40 mins otherwise everything else excellent
643,1 very good
6267,"Ophthalmology - difficulty contacting - I understand the problems of staffing under covid situation but feel I must remark on the fact that despite continuous efforts to contact the department (phoning again as soon as we got a busy report, phoning via switchboard, using internet address given n the letter) it has been impossible to contact anyone regarding whether to cancel an appointment for a non-covid related cough and sore-throat, developed overnight."
104,"If I could give less then one star I would. My sister has an ongoing problem and we had many visits at the A&E (we went 6 times in the last 7 months). The first time my sister was so bad she couldn't walk, they were very rude and didn't seem to care, the gynecologist was nowhere to be found, after a very long wait they finally found her and when she visited my sister she was also very rude and her only objective was to get her to leave. the only thing the gyno did was to take 2 swabs which were never found. so she did nothing and send my sister home with no cure, no investigation, nothing. The second time they did a surgery but then found out it wasn't what they thought it was. I'm very disappointed in NHS overall, its been7 month we are trying to figure out what is happening with my sister and they have no answers and also refused to do more investigations. The only thing they are giving her is antibiotics all over again for 7 times in 7 months. Ridiculous!!! Why are we paying taxes if we are left to die basically."
2019,Really good to see #LifeAndBirth touch on mental health tonight. @BWH_NHS hospital has an amazing mother & baby team that I used following the death of my son during birth.I will never be able to thank them enough for putting me back together x
3318,So now I have 8 #RareDiseases and the only person responsible for my care and meds RX are my humble @BucksHealthcare GP surgery. Thank god my local one has plenty of good GPs but seriously?! ?! ?? How can a complex #CEV patient get abandoned like this? #Accountability #PALS

8723,Orthopaedics - Appallingly bad - It is always difficult to complain about the NHS yet when its bad its truely cruelly seriously b. a. d. Offhand. Unbelievably noisy. Overheated. Unsafe.

2608,"I was admitted on 20/01/21 (via the CDU) to Yeovil District Hospital with periorbital cellulitis and severe fever / flue type symptoms, received treatment and was discharged on 25/01/21 with a course of oral antibiotics. Recovery at home is going swimmingly. I have in the past encountered health care staff (NOT in Yeovil) who were inpatient, condescending and generally disrespectful towards me, not that I have ever been a challenging and rude patient. Really I can't thank enough all the staff from all the departments at Yeovil District Hospital who dealt with me. Every single one of them was approachable, caring, well mannered and professional. Most especially good were the nurses and health care assistants on ward 9b who acted with care and professionalism towards some awkward and difficult patients whilst I was there. They have the patience of saints! I wish Yeovil District Hospital all the best, keep up the good work! "
8360,I was seen very quickly. All the staff were very professional. I could not have hoped for better.
4258,"General Surgery - Caring and professional service - My husband was admitted to ACU yesterday and then to ward F3. I would just like to say what a fantastic team you have at the hospital, despite the challenges you have on a daily basis. I would particularly like to single out the staff nurse and her team at ACU. They were truly lovely and kind all day as well as being efficient and I really did feel that my husband was being well cared for. At the end of their shift they went over and above their duty trying to find beds before the unit closed. in fact when my husband moved to F3 at around 8pm it was already an hour after their unit should have closed and they were still trying to find 2 patients a bed. The staff nurse's persistence and composure were amazing and I could have wept knowing that this was probably not a 'one off'. Never once did I hear her complain or moan (and I was mostly no more than a few feet away). She is a complete professional as are her team. I am so grateful. I would love for her to get recognition for her sense of duty of care and for her team to also be acknowledged. We, and you, are so lucky to have them."

9996,"Minor injuries unit - Make you wait UNNECESSARILY - The care you receive is the best BUT the wait to see someone is ridiculous, they don't look busy, it seems to me they just like you to wait, it's turned into a NHS thing to do, keep patients waiting just because they can! "

1482,"I would highly recommend Mr Stevens for the great care and treatment provided by him and his team. It has now been 7 weeks since I had implantable contact lens (ICL) surgery and I have been astounded by the results, which have been far better than I could have possibly expected. I was originally intending to have laser eye surgery but due to my strong prescription was advised against this. Mr Stevens took the time to explain exactly how ICL would work and how it would be beneficial too me and was very happy to answer all of my questions. When it came to the surgery itself, the experience was so smooth and easy, with no pain or discomfort at all. Again, Mr Stevens too the time to answer my questions and to ensure that I was happy with everything before proceeding. I was amazed, within one hour of completing the surgery, to have 20/20 vision, and this has now further improved. For someone who has been wearing contact lenses or spectacles since the age of six, this has been absolutely miraculous for me and has changed my life."

2334,"Adult Mental Illness - Need to be listened to more - My issue, my main issue - is that the NHS has known be now for 20 years. However, the questions ask you are always 1. are you taking your medication 2. are you getting any side effects 3. are you hearing voices However, I have only had 1 member of staff, who really helped, a Dr in the community, who had time to ask me how are you? and listen to how I say what my stressors are, however that hasn't happened since, and I lot of stressors have happened since I saw that Dr 15 years ago, however staff only know of that 1 issue I had many many years ago now, that I feel I have recovered from, and it frustates that I can pick up a helpline number when I 'm at home (where I feel safe), and they have only 1 hour but they are able to listen to an incredable amount, after which I feel ok again. I don't understand why, in 15 years why I haven't had, even 1 hour of staff listening to my experiences, what I am stressed about. They know all about my medication and each time I get asked I talk about the side effects. And with voices, I have only heard voices once in my life 20 years ago, so they same response I get asked is always no. I am now getting phone support each week, the same 3 questions get asked, I give the same responses. However, now they ask me what I have done today, so I have to tell them what I have eaten, at what times, the housework I have done, in which room, how many times I have chatted to my neighbour - the text messages I have sent and to who, what I watched on netflix, what time I got up in the morning, what time did I feed my wildlife, what time I cleaned the wildlife poo from my wildlife feeding station, what music I might listen to this evening. Every week. they back by saying, that sounds ok to me.. I can speak to a compete stranger -and talk to them, they will find out more information about my concerns, my experiences in 20 mins, so how many more years is it going to take the NHS to find out my experiences, and things that might stress out, over the last 15 years.

My personal experience - visits, calls and communications to and from the team - has resulted in my wish to express our immense gratitude to all involved. At a time that has been so challenging for all in the NHS because of Covid; and for my parent (and our family) as we accept and adjust to the realities of a very cruel illness; everyone I have met at Parklands (from reception to ward and medical teams) have been the best I could have imagined.

4389,"Dental Care - I am writing further with regards to my brother. He has been suffering with his teeth for years. He has severe mental health problems. He has been advised time and time again to call 111 with regards to the excruciating shooting pains in his mouth and jaw. The outcome of all appointments has been giving him more antibiotics, repeatedly. As a family, we have tried to get him registered with a dentist as Charles Clifford Dental Hospital would not treat him without a referral. As his sister, I paid for him to go private, just so we could get a referral. The waiting list at Charles Clifford is months so my family are in a position whereby treatment is urgently needed. We are forced to go private and it looks like we will be paying for this treatment at a cost of around 300 per tooth extraction. For a man who has nothing more to his name than the clothes he is wearing I think this is terrible."

2085,i would recommend the ambulance service usually they are all brilliant. except for last night after a paramedic failed to book my 8 month old prem baby in after she had rolled off our bed and banged her head. we was left sat in the waiting area for hours and nobody even knew we was there because they didnt do the handover! when i confronted doctors at the hospital why i was still sat waiting after numerous children was in and out being seen my daughter had no obs done or any...thing the whole time we were there waiting because they were all completely unaware we was there and had to retake our details... not to mention the paramedic was falling asleep in the back of the ambulance on the way to the hospital.... all paramedics do an amazing job but last night couldve easily been avoided if anything wouldve happened to my daughter those paramedics wouldve been held responsible!

6147,Accident and emergency services - Excellent service - attended for suturing was seen and treated and left within two hours talk about quick and efficient service. Thank to the very kind doctor who did my sutures and also to the consultant in charge at the time who reviewed my case swiftly and promptly and agreed with my suggestions on the best course of treatment. its nice that the staff involve their patients in the decisions they make on their care and treatment as it makes a huge difference to putting people at ease. Cannot recommend this service and the staff highly enough!!!! 
698,For this particular visit it could not have been improved. I marked it down slightly due to the very poor dealings I have had with that hospital in the past which are unforgivable.
4039,I arrived with an injured foot in quite a bit of pain. The reception staff were fantastic and I was seen by a wonderful sister who booked me in for an x-ray the next morning as the x-ray dept. was closed. The next morning I was seen within half an hour. Excellent service. Thank you all.

6404,This hospital is really horrible! I waited in the urgent care last night for 5 hours checked by the GP then he said he will book me for a scan the next day so I have to stay at home and wait for their call. Have been waiting and tried to call them and the woman on the phone said they have a massive backlog that the scan will not happen today! when i told the woman that their hospital is really bad she just laughed and said there are other hospital around! i dont recommend coming here for any reason tbh! they will not look after you but instead will make you worse! what a joke!

1752,"Terrible service - I had a phone call from Highlands House after a referral was made from Tunbridge Wells hospital following a hospital admission. I was told to just 'stay on my medication and get counselling'. I even asked is that all and I was told 'yes that's all'. I feel completely let down and ignored, this was an urgent referral that was made and I've not been offered any support or help with finding support. There is no way I would recommend to anyone with any kind of low mood, the conversation lasted about 15mins and I feel completely dismissed. No advice of follow up support, no offer of any other support."

5097,My son was transferred here to the NICU less than 24 hours after birth for surgery and recovery because of a birth defect called esophageal atresia. I can say that the team that operated on him and the staff that work in NICU are nothing less than amazing. I am American and this is my first experience (aside from where he was born) with the NHS and medical care in England. I am throughly impressed. I would recommend this place to anyone. Thank you so much to everyone at Rosie Hospital! We are forever grateful for you saving our baby boy.

From the initial reception, all the staff, including nursing and support staff and the theatre team were courteous sympathetic skilled and professional. I was at the hospital for four hours and I observed these standards applied to all other patients in this ward. Particular praise for the consultant for the manner with which he dealt with me at all times, especially during the procedure itself. Although I am not medically qualified I must say that his skill and expertise is highly impressive. All was handled so well, down to calling me a taxi to get home and the very informative Discharge Pack I was sent home with Many thanks Heatherwood and the NHS Jon Foster"
3399,Very efficient service  | Absolutely nothing 
3670,"Accident and emergency services - Took great care of me all day HAPPY - I was brought into A&E at around 10am this morning (on a saturday) due to tonsillitis turning into an abcess at the back of my throat. My symptoms were quite severe (e.g. blood in vomit, couldn't eat / swallow, and I was having sharp stabbing pains in my side due to such an empty stomach). I was seen after around 2 hours and then referred to a doctor, who then referred me to a throat specialist. By around 4pm, I was placed in a ward upstairs for the rest of the night. The waiting times are sometimes a bit long but that is to be expected when the doctors are very thorough and careful with how they treat each patient. I think many need to remember that there is most likely someone with a more urgent illness and there are only so many nurses / doctors that can help at once. They do incredibly well for the amount of people they have to tend to. Unfortunately, I had to have the abcess drained with a needle which was not a pleasant experience, but afterwards they put me on a saline drip and shot some antibiotics and steroids into me and I can now swallow with absolutely no pain. All the staff have been so attentive and friendly and I could not have asked for a more relieving experience. I was able to eat my first meal in 3 days and it was actually really nice. Many people complain about hospital food but the shephard's pie I had with mash, veggies and gravy was comforting and delicious. I feel so much better and I look forward to going home tomorrow."
9715,"Don't know - Heartwarming care - I had a miscarriage which turned out to be incomplete, so after 3 visits to the Early Pregnancy Unit, where I was very well looked after, I decided to have a surgical miscarriage management. The procedure took place on the 11th Jan, in the afternoon and the care I received by all the staff was incredible. The operating theatre staff kept me entertained with lovely conversations while we were waiting for the surgeon to start. It was a very international team of people and although they behaved very differently from each other, they had a common goal and worked together to achieve it. In times of division and distance, it was really heartwarming to see such collaboration, care, professionalism and big smiles underneath our masks. I just wish this message could reach them as I was asleep before I could say ‚Äòthank you! ' All the nurses in the day surgery centre were really lovely too. Thank you all for the incredible work you do every day! "

6111,"Wonderful staff and a kind, compassionate atmosphere. Every single member of staff I have come across (and that includes a couple of dozen now) has been warm, kind and helpful. They are managing under the additional pressure of Covid rules very well and at no point does it interfere with their relationships with patients and visitors. If you get lost in the hospital, there is always someone on hand to guide you. The chapel is peaceful and lovely: a haven to sit in if you're stressed and worried. You don't need to be religious. If you have to be sent to hospital, this is a good place to go."
6950,"Lack of empathy or support - I was referred to physio by the doctor and the staff member I felt was blunt, un-supportive and quite hurtful considering the amount of pain I was in and my poor mental health. Despite my sobbing with the pain, I was told basically that my issues were because I was overweight and that they couldn't do anything so would refer me back to the doctor! I was left feeling so lonely, hurt both physically and mentally and totally helpless."

6366,"Could improve - I have visited Cardiology at Epsom twice in recent weeks. On both occasions I had the opportunity to observe the staff while I waited. Not all of them present in a professional way. One has long hair, not tied back which is untidy and lank, she addresses the pts as ‚Äòlove', which is not in accordance with the Equality & Diversity guidance. Another said Ta to a pt instead of Thank You. Only a few have ID or name badges and two were discussing a pt within the hearing of people waiting. Some, I imagine, are unqualified but that should not mean untrained. There is a certain way people expect to be treated when they visit a hospital, professionalism at all levels is mandatory. The attitude in that unit is far too casual and relaxed. In addition, because no name badges are worn, and they all wear theatre scrubs, it is impossible to tell what designation most of the staff are. I retired from nursing only a few months ago and was, at one time, a Sister within this Trust as well as a Lead Nurse in the community. I would never have allowed the sloppy image I witnessed today to exist on my watch. Times change, I appreciate that, but standards ought not to drop because of it. I do not include the reception staff in my observation, they were perfectly professional. Whoever manages this unit, needs to take note and improve the presentation and attitude of the staff. It is as if some of them find it hard to draw the distinction between being in a socially relaxed situation and displaying a workplace persona. Frankly, I get a more professional attitude from my hairdresser. I'm sure whoever reads this will take my point. "

5639,"I was rushed into the L&D on Saturday Morning presenting, what looked like a mini stroke. The excellent care and attention was something I have only witnessed on Hilby City TV programme. But this was for real. I was assessed immediately, and a decision to put me into the A&E assessment unit was made. I had a cat scan quickly to determine a bleed to the brain. And an MRI was arranged also. By 5pm I was being moved up to ward 3. The care and attention to detail was first class. I was welcomed onto the ward by sister Anna and her team. All relevant tests taken ie ; COVID swabs and MRSA swabs. I was made comfortable with a jug of water and a cup of tea. The next morning 9am I was off down for my MRI. I'm here now 5 days and I came in with nothing but the cloths I was wearing in the ambulance. Everything was provided to me to make my stay as stress free as possible. I want ro take this opportunity to say a big THANK YOU to both medical teams in A&E who are working endlessly to help people who are in need of urgent care. Then to the sisters and their teams of nursing staff on the wards, down to the housekeeping, You are all Amazing üåà keep up the great work that you are all doing. Finally Thank you for taking excellent care of me. ü•∞"

9135,"Horrendous place to give birth induction gets booked by a consultant then you can wait up to a week in there for a bed due to labouring women or emergencies leaving your whole family behind at home. Lots of midwives with coughs and colds, terrible food frozen then microwaved and plopped on a plate so constant tummy pain before your labour even begins. No pain relief other than paracetamol after a sweep that could leave you with hours of contractions but will not give you gas and air unless dilated to 3cm+ and will not help you labour further if no bed leaving you abandoned and in agony. Lets in psrtners on induction and postntal wards with coughs and zero supervision over masks yet swab women for covid when they come in but not the visitors or birth psrtner who can spend from 2-8PM near you and your vulnerable baby. Will keep you on a catheter as a kings protocol for 12 hours after a vaginal birth and if requested to remove will be told off and say your defying medical advice. Sends assistants to answer buzzer who then have to go find your midwife and never come back numerous times. Never go here to have a baby it's gone down hill majorly"

The discharge notes were not given to me and had to be tracked down by the nurse, the prescription was not written by the time I was leaving and the nurse had to find another Dr. to complete. The dosage was incorrect according to the pharmacist and my GP and on collecting my prescription from the pharmacy, we found that the prescription had not been signed or dated by the doctor."

9085,"Neurosurgery - Paeds Neurosurgery / PICU / Nicholls Ward - Outstanding care - Unfortunately we are regular visitors to St Georges. My daughter has just had her 2nd Spinal Op (1st one Jan19). My daughter is very anxious and a little traumatised by previous medical intervention (not at at StGs). The Surgeons and specialist spinal nurse that treat her are always compassionate, empathetic and explain things clearly without frightening her. As upsetting as it is watching your child go into theatre for spinal surgery, both times I have always felt confident that she is in the safest of hands with a highly skilled team. We have been in PICU both times after surgery for one or two nights, not from complications but to make sure that she is stable before going to the ward and the team in PICU have been amazing. They are so very caring and do there upmost to make sure that your child is as comfortable as they can be. Also making sure that you are ok to, they get a 10 out of 10 HAPPY Moving onto the Nicholls ward, again you cannot fault the care we've received. Every nurse that has looked after my daughter has been fantastic and taken the extra time with her when needed due to her anxiety, they also get 10 out of 10! My daughter still has one more operation to go but as scared as she is, she knows that the whole team of people that look after her will make a scary and horrible time for her that little bit better. As always we are forever grateful to the NHS and the team at St Georges for looking after my daughter, so thank you."
3375,"I thought that all staff were very professional, friendly & helpful.I was dealt with very efficiently, and didnt have to wait as long as expected.One small thing - I had injured my ankle, and was in pain, but still had to stand to do some of the booking in, it would have been better if I could have sat down.Otherwise- I was extremely impressed with the staff & treatment."
1732,".My visit to Lincoln A&E - Firstly I did acknowledge that I was neither an accident or an emergency as I did my injury on the Saturday. This was the Monday. I had injured my arm in the same place as it had previously been broken and was pinned & plated so all I really needed was an x-ray to check the nuts and bolts were all in place. So after A&E assessment was then led to M. I. U. After being examined I was told no, I don't need an x-ray all was still in place and it was soft tissue damage. I felt like an attention seeking hypochondriac, who had wasted their time, my time and 2 taxi fares but the nurses were great."

The COVID check, how I was given the hospital masks and the appointment time checked. I was pleasantly surprised with the Endoscopy unit a brand new building. The building and the way I was treated by all the nurses and the consultant and the time they gave me was very impressive. This was my first visit to a NHS hospital for treatment and I can definitely say I received first class service. Thank you very much to every member of staff who looked after me today and thank you for all what you do every day for people like me."

8201,"I want to Express how grateful I am for the staff at cov hospital, because no matter what their job was, weather cleaning, serving food and drinks, taking blood and giving medications they were all so kind and warm, they took the time to talk to you while they worked, while they work during a time when things are so unsure, they still treated each patient with kindness and a smile (pretty hard to see with masks on) but as much pain I was in I was as comfortable as they all could make me and I felt safe and as if I was in good hands. The NHS deserve better than they are getting. Thank you ward 22 ‚ù§"

1110,"I visited St Thomas' Hospital for 3 times for the same reason and all the time staffs were rude and even directed me to wrong places. I went to early pregnancy unit due to problem I felt and they send me to A&E and at A&E, they asked why not going to early pregnancy unit. And second time I visited early pregnancy unit, staff there were saying out loud that I can't read your hand writing. There was no problem with my handwriting and never heard that before in my life. I felt that was discriminating. She complained about my hand writing continuously. I was able to tell that other patients there seemed very surprised hearing that. Nurses and doctor was so gentle but staffs at the front desk is so rude, unfriendly and every one was uncomfortable with them. Worst pregnancy unit ever. I choose to go other pregnancy unit even it has bit distant away from my office."

6914,"There was a homeless man at hospital yesterday, everyone was looking at him like scum, he was quiet, polite and very ill and couldnt hold himself up. he fell off the chair and fell asleep on the floor. The security came and told him they have warned him if he doesnt sit in the chair he wont be seen and they will call police. He got in the chair politly, no argument with 3 of them helping him to get up so they knew he couldnt get himself up. He sat there for another hour or so... really struggling in pain then he finally cried i cant anymore its to hot and fell off the chair. The nurses walked past and said for god sake hes on the floor again call security so they came and told him they warned him if he wanted to be seen he had to sit in the chair so now they will get police to take him away. The nurse got on the phone to police so i went in and said this is not fair you cant treat him like that he needs help, hes been sat in that chair for hours and done nothing wrong and has fallen off in pain and he doesnt deserve to be treated this way. The secrity man got nasty and came in my face shouting how do you think others feel looking at that agressivly in my face like he was going to hit me or something, absolutly disgusting all because he was homeless to talk about him that way. I said dont you dare start being rude to me aswel then another lady came and said well done for sticking up for him i agree, then another said iv witnessed it to and hes done nothing wrong and then all started to agree and the security man backed down after knowing most people were feeling the same about there bullying. The police came but after hearing he had done no wrong they picked him up and said were not arresting you we are taking you over to a&e to get you seen as an emergency. A man came to me after and said well done for sticking up for that man, everyone felt the same but knowone spoke up. Corona seems to have given secrity people some weird idea that they have power over everyone and can bully everyone and act like they have authority to do what they like and look down on everyone, we need to come together and show them they cant get away with it. If they had removed him they wouldve been chucking him out and leaving him for dead See More"
3793,Staff Attitude 
37,Don't know - Telephone service is dreadful - Getting the switchboard to answer the phone takes on average 30 minutes' my 88 year old mother was rushed in and I was trying to get an update. I also tried to call back blood department that called me and that was through switchboard again I think the music you have to listen to is very annoying when waiting so long. It says sorry to keep you waiting but when you have heard that god knows how many times the apology does not sound sincere!! 
9867,Compassion 
750,Eye - accident and emergency services - Professional treatment - long waiting time. - Greeted promptly and temperature checked. Unfortunately had to wait over 2 hours before being seen. Just unlucky but do recommend contacting department by telephone before visiting if possible. Totally worth the wait and I appreciated the apology given. My treatment was efficient and professional. Thankyou. There are signs for parking but unable to find the site. Parked on a side road.

725,"Obstetrics And Gynaecology - Very good aftercare - I would like to extend my gratitude to all staff involved in my aftercare following my recent surgery. The ward environment was spotless, the HCA's (particularly one lady) were very professional and treated all patients with dignity and understanding. Requests for painkilling medication was dealt with in good time which was reassuring. If I had to add a note of negativity it would be that the food was of a poor quality (excluding the breakfasts). However, I did not have much of an appetite so this was of a minor concern. Well done to all staff. Never underestimate that good care and compassion go a long way in aiding recovery. I am a fellow healthcare professional and a member of the Patients Association and am proud that Good Hope Hospital offered me a good experience."

8900,"My husband - My husband was admitted to Exeter hospital in October. He is 79 years old, and on dialysis. His blood count had dropped and he was breathless and getting chest pains. He was on Creedy ward. Last Friday evening a doctor called me and said they didn't expect him to last the night. They thought he had had a heart attack and also had pneumonia. He was taken to the dialysis unit this evening and given 2 units of blood. After the dialysis the porter took him to another ward. Avon ward. But no one has explained anything to him, he was left by a bed. Then someone brought his things and dumped them by his bed, again not even acknowledging him. My husband is a mild mannered person and was feeling too exhausted to ask. He was left to get himself into bed. I said to him get to sleep and I will call them in the morning. It's very scary for me, him and his sons."

I shouted stop which he did.I called an ambulance which took 20mins and they talked to him and conveyed him to the A&E at Homerton. They discharged him two hours later without doing nothing, since I had told him not to return home until he was better they discharged him to the street! And he slept in a porch. He had taken a combination of drugs, he obviously had a psychotic break from reality, he had thrown away everything including his bed, clothes, phone, the lot. I was so grateful to the London Ambulance crew who were very nice and professional, but the A&E I wouldn't recommend."

4421,"My wife was referred to the Grace Unit following colposcopy and biopsy at Yeovil Hospital in August 2019. By 25 September her endometrial (womb) cancer had been confirmed, CT / MRI scans and day case EUA (for Staging) done and she had been discharged home following laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. This was followed by review by a Consultant Oncologist and brachytherapy at the Bristol Haematology and Oncology Centre. Throughout this process, the care given to both her and me was outstanding. As soon as we arrived at the Grace Unit, we felt cared for by every member of staff we encountered at every stage and at every level. Everything was patiently explained, we were involved in the diagnostic and treatment decisions and our initial fear was dispelled by the certainty that these people were going to do their best for her. I could cite numerous examples of staff doing beyond the necessary but have one memory which I feel sums up the attitude of all those who cared for her. A nurse came down to collect her from the Surgical Admissions Lounge to walk her to the operating theatre. She took her arm, started to walk down the corridor and then turned to me, smiled and said Don't worry, we'll look after her. And they did. Thank you. All."

376,"Absolutely appalling, sent home from A&E at 2:30 a.m as doctor didn't think it was urgent. Went to another hospital where surgery was carried out within 3 days. Had this not been done sooner chances of paralysis etc. Doctor didn't seem to care. Absolutely fuming at this place, will never knowingly step foot in the place again"
5256,From the time I arrived in Endoscopy Unit staff were pleasant I was attended to straight away and the rest of stay was well organised despite the difficult times we are experiencing.
8376,All the midwives really nice | Nothing
1731,Staff Attitude 
9466,Ran to time. Told what was going to happen.
6040,Fantastic service - Unfortunately we have had to visit York hospital for several reasons and we have had excellent service every time we have been. I cannot praise the service from York hospital enough. They are punctual polite and extremely professional. Well done York hospital.
636,"Going to hospital with a broken or sprained foot and having to limp around the building on it, especially when the notes I received at the end advised me to ""rest it"" seems counterproductive. | Have something in place so that until you know the foot/ankle/leg is fine to walk on, you aren't expected to. Or at least not halfway around the building and back again."
9970,"Great care on all admissions but limited food choice - I was admitted twice in one week, both times onto the AMUB ward then transferred to ward B20 on my first admission and then ward D1 on my second admission. I have nothing but praise for all the doctors, nurses, HCAs, TNAs, porters et al that I interacted with from the ED to my admission on the wards. Every member of staff I encountered was friendly, professional, more than willing to go above and beyond for you answering any questions and in assisting you in becoming well again. The only negative I have is that in 2020 the food was very limited for me because of my restrictive diet, I am lactose intolerant and eat a plant based diet, it was very hit and miss and I think that this is something that needs to be looked at and greatly improved. (See attached photos of some of the ‚Äúmisses‚Äù)."
5892,Best childrens hospital in the UK helped me though all my operations and when I had menanjites thanks alder hey
8986,Diagnostic Endoscopy - Great Staff - I had a diagnostic Gastroscopy without sedation. All the staff were very helpful and I only had a short wait before the procedure. The clinical staff involved gave me a running commentary and encouragement during the investigation. The whole experience was much less stressful than I feared due to the professionalism of the staff 
637,I had both of my c19 injections there

1121,Excellent service and friendly and professionsal doctors and staff. Perfection cannot be improved!
841,"I attended the walk in centre via triage as I was unable to make an appointment with my GP ( no available appointment). The treatment that I received from Nurse Chivers was first class. She diagnosed my condition, prescribed medication and gave sound advice. I am happy to confirm that my condition has much improved. If the walk in centre was not available I would have presented myself at the nearest accident and emergency department. Many thanks for the care and advice provided. .5 star treatment."
2496,Don't know - Thank you - Just visited DVT clinic. Seen on time and dealt with in a most friendly and professional manner. Got the result I hoped for! Thanks to all staff! 
9612,Blood clots DVT - I was experiencing a very swollen leg which was aching and stiff. Managed to get a quick appointment at the Doctors who quickly diagnosed DVT and potential blood clot. They arranged an emergency appointment at the AEC at the Hospital who confirmed that I did have a blood clot. Appropriate medical treatment was initiated. Very grateful to the fast response of Belgrave Medical Centre staff to what could have been a life threatening Pulmanary Embolism.

928,Bit more privacy Bit more privacy 
3172,"Don't know - Short stay surgical unit / Orthopaedic - Wow! A very busy unit, twice daily patients admitted for surgery, some are day cases some stay over night. Due to the world's current situation there's a strong urge to get patients treated and home as quick as possible. Staff rushed off their feet through out the day, buzzer sounding frequently, the nurses taking care of the patients who have returned from the theatres, giving them a hot drink, a sandwich, fruit, yoghurts or cereals. They still have time to talk comfort or laugh with the patients. Not the best place to return to following a leg procedure when your unable to walk to the toilet, its hard to ring for a nurse when you can hear how they are rushing around. Neither is it the best place when you have dietary requirements, they don't cater for gluten and lactose intolerance. The staff don't have spare time to run around sorting out foods that are gluten and lactose free. Following leg surgery which is non weight bearing, then seeing a member of the physiotherapist team 6 hours after that surgery standing by my bed, wasn't the best move. Still groggy, not young and nimble didn't get me out and home any quicker! Thank you to the day and night staff who kept me going until I left 2 nights later. You are incredible people ‚ù£ My consultant has also gone above and beyond caring for me over the years! Could have done with a raised seat for the toilet!! "

When asking about the wait time got told to wait another 2 hours until a doctors is available. In total spent 8 hours in A&E after being informed to attend under urgency. Went out with no blood sample and wasted all this time for nothing due to this overrunning to 2AM! All this time for A BLOOD SAMPLE RESULT. Absoloute joke of a hospital. Got addmited with high risk and urgency due to possible risk of death and has to wait all this time to go home empty handed."

It's nice they cater for everyone and if u need something they have a m&s and a WH Smith's which will cover almost everything u need.

3822,"Totally dedicated - Admitted late November with suspected COVID-19 unable to breath I received nothing but totally dedicated treatment from staff at the North Middlesex Hospital. From cleaners right up to top medical professionals everyone was kind and considerate and I am obliged to covey my thanks. My stay lasted 13 days, having never previously had in patient experience and being in an isolated room as time passed I found I was getting mentally drained but by speaking to doctors I was given support to help with this. It is not possible to convey in these few short words how thankful I am that I was taken to the North Middlesex Hospital for treatment, I have no doubt that all hospitals work just as hard I just know that potentially there were two outcomes to my illness and I have been given life. A big thank you to all and congratulations for the dedication and hard work I have seen performed day in day out without any expectation other than the successful treatment and discharge of patients. My love and most respectful regards. Peter."

8692,"Changed my life for the better. - I'm an outpatient, but I started seeing a doctor a few months ago for persistent physical symptoms. My doctor has listened to me through everything and is trying everything to help. I have learnt more about my symptoms in these short months than any doctor is 6 years. I feel positive again that with my doctors help I can control this better. I don't know where I would be without this service right now. Thank you for giving me my hope back. "
6076,Very helpful!!
6125,"Lovely staff - Visited Cheltenham A&E and was very anxious. All the staff greeted me with a smile and reassurances, within 30 mins I was more relaxed having gone through triage and when I saw the doctor he explained everything well and again was very reassuring, he took a good deal of time ensuring that I was happy with the outcome and understood how to move forward with it. Marvellous staff."

3407,Fantastic caring staff - Tonight i attended Bunnyhill out of hours for a blood test. The test was completed by a a nurse with a Scottish accent. I have had several blood tests and used to be extremely phobic but I have never been put as ease as much as I was tonight. She is is a credit to the profession and I walked away feeling she should be praised for how fantastic she was. The whole experience was positive and I wouldn't hesitate in visiting this centre again. 
770,very kind and profesional team
2082,"Don't know - Wolfson fertility centre - For some reason it's not listed in Hammersmith hospital list of depts. It is poles apart from the main hospital - it's quiet, calm, clean, polite, knowledgeable- they really look after you and on the first go I've been successful. I can't thank them enough - it felt like I was having private health care the whole way through. Don't hesitate go to the wolfson. My only comment that's negative is the awful pharmacy in Hammersmith hospital where you have to get the medicine. The fertility unit would be on time and quick so u could be in and out but the pharmacy in the hospital (which is separate) let's down Hammersmith hospital - queues of people, a very rude main dude who mans it who I had to tell not to speak to me like that. It's always over run and prescriptions can take anywhere from 20 mins to 45 mins to be serviced. This was the bit that made every appointment a 2 hour round trip. However don't let this put you off the wolfson as it's not their fault how Lloyd's pharmacy run their business in the main hospital and I'd take the care and knowledge of the ivf unit and calmness of it any day over having fast prescriptions.

I asked if it was possible to out if a friend was at the hospital and instead of telling me that reception was closed and it would be a problem, put me through to A & E who of course were too busy to answer the phone, When I rang her back she was rather patronising and upset me with her bossy attitude."
8659,"I've never been one to be too dramatic over illness. I went for 15 years without seeing my GP. I had a Vertigo episode recently, whereby, I felt that there was something serious happening to me. I would be the last person ever to ask for an ambulance to be called out but I genuinely felt like a heart attack was coming on or that I'd had a minor stroke. I can only say that the care and attendance and understanding I had from New Cross staff was nothing short of exceptional. There were a lot of trainee staff dealing with me but they were very transparent about it and everybody seemed to be learning. God bless the NHS. Long live the NHS! A big shout-out to Andy, who took me from my cubicle to have a head scan. I was so scared, I cannot even explain, but he put my nerves at ease, without even trying. A lot of people can and will criticise, but by god, when I felt I needed them, they were there. Big up NHS."

I rang the only number I had for this service but since the gynaecology service has recently moved to St. Mary's, the number is now used in a different service (I think it's the oral maxillofacial service). The lady who answered had no background to my query aside from my distressed explanation of my appointment being six months overdue and my anxiety regarding this delay. Despite not working in the service area I was trying to contact, this lady calmly took my details and then found the correct number I needed to ring. I was very grateful as finding this number on Google had been impossible (I think there are a lot of old, outdated webpages for MFT's gynaecology service). She even told me to ring back if I had any difficulties. She really didn't need to do this and many people might have just told me I'd come through to the wrong service and that was it. So thank you very much to the lady who answered the phone on 0161 291 4264. You went above and beyond for me. I now have my appointment book for mid-June and you were so helpful in this for me."

But you cant walk in - you need to phone. They gave me a number and said I just had to keep trying, if I don't get through.

Notes take three days to get to your DR who cannot carry on treatment until he has heard from them. So the reason you were sent in escalates back to where you started. Total waste if time."
1830,reassuring polite and efficient
6196,"Accident and emergency services - Care and attention - I'm a 38 year old male with very little experience of the NHS due to my age. Today, I had to go to medway hospitals A&E department at the request of my GP. The care and attention I received was exceptional. The staff their are truly world class. From the triage nurse through to the doctors that took care of me. I'm truly humbled by my experience. KEEP IT UP! Well done and thank you. "
3978,Cardiology - Professional caring staff - I attended as outpatient for echocardiogram. I was quickly reassured and relaxed whilst the procedure was thoroughly conducted. I remain so impressed and grateful to the wonderful staff at this hospital who have helped me to an active 84th year of family and working life
42,Best vasectomy I've ever had
1070,Never fail to be impressed by staff who feel so motivated to do the right thing. ABC B in action @BWC_NHS
6287,Urgent care centre - Poor service - I took my daughter to haywood because my Gp told me to but the some of the staff don't really care about other people's feelings my daughter had a fall at school and was in severe pain and limping was told to go home and give her calpol because knees are very difficult to break after waiting for 3 hours. I took her back the next day and insisted that she needs to be properly looked at and we they did send her for an x-ray and they found out that something was wrong as did a referral to the fracture clinic. Imagine if I didn't go back and insisted for her to be looked at 
6707,All doctors and nurses were very helpful and friendly. Waiting Tim | Waiting time was good.
8533,"I don't recommend it, it's the worst place ever, like the hospitals in the third developing country, nobody there care about patients."
174,"Stroke - Excellent Service - My husband suffered a TIA on 11 September, and was taken to A&E, and received excellent service. The following day he went to the TIA clinic, and oh my, was the service good. We felt that we could not have been treated better in a private hospital. Understanding and polite staff, the consultant was superb and tea and biscuits were even served whilst waiting! Thank you NNUH for looking after my husband, you are the best! "
4208,Dear @MattHancock my friend works in a care home. She has symptoms. 111 directed her to @UHSFT to be tested. They turned her away as it's only for NHS. So don't say testing is happening. It's not.
982,"Arrived 5.30am and eventually left at 8.00am, having never seen a doctor during this time. Urgent care unit was quiet as a mouse. But could still here doctor having casual chat with nurses. The NHS is finished."
8403,1 indeed...
543,I fully support the NHS in general anyway and having now had cause to use the A&E Department I am simply very impressed with the professionalism and kind caring nature of all the staff.Full marks.
1157,Great practice - Had my first shot of Astra zeneca this morning. The staff from the parking area right through were very pleasant and very efficient. They were well organised and I felt ‚Äòlooked after'. Would recommend this clinic.

9421,Helpful friendly & kind staff were all outstanding.
3278,Everything was so easy and no stress at all! Well done!
7793,"The service is poor in general as we all know it, health service isn't world class as expected from a hospital point of view. Expectations is higher specially from one of the richest county in the world should have decent health ‚Ä¶"
9212,Experience 1 very good.Nurse very reassuring and helpful
1327,"A weight lifted - I was very impressed with the Dr from Wandsworth Home Treatment Team. She was organised and methodical. She asked relevant questions and explored gently when my answers were not clear. An excellent bedside manner. Once she had come to a conclusion she explained succinctly what options were available and then promptly took action to seek a solution. After two weeks of frustration I finally felt that someone understood my condition, sympathised and helped. Thank you Dr "
9972,"I'll be clapping even louder on Thursday for the brilliant NHS..thanks resuss nurse (Kate, I think her name was) for making my visit to resuss a breeze. Kindness, compassion and reassurance. Nurses need a pay rise! @NHSHarlow"

8365,"I was treated at all times with kindness and respect, I think every member of the hospital staff are brilliant, thank you all."
6048,on behalf of our dad who was admitted yesterday 14th March 2020 i would like to thank the Doctor at Park Leys Practice ...ambulance crew...A&E Resus for their care and professionalism. we feel at a time of when they are so under staffed and receive so much negative press its time people realised how they cope and still provide a professional service with all the pressures they are under at the moment. Thanks again for looking after our dad.
4776,"Incredibly efficient, friendly, competent and hard working. Was so impressed how quickly I was processed. Fabulous hospital, amazing staff."
2016,"I have had sudden severe back , thighs, calves, and feet pain for the last 3 months treated by painkillers. whilst my condition has not been diagnosed by my Dr. or Orthopaedics it was comforting to speak on the phone to Ailis.I now have been given Exercise sheets which I will start today, and I have a Video call booked with Ailis on 13 October"
7662,"Just want to say thank you to all the team at Salisbury Especially the plastics team, I have spent two days in there and what a great team they have, everyone made a massive effort to make sure I was always ok and considering the current circumstances we are all in and for how busy they were over those days, so want to say a massive thank you to u all and keep up hard work See you on Monday"
5309,Had to wait an hour for appt - not good enough! Could have been surrounded with covid symptoms from other people as no temperature taken at any stage!
7704,"Physiotherapy department literally is the worst i ever saw in my life. Kids instead of doctors, without even a small understanding of what they have to do."
1811,Easy process from ordering on line to delivery next day. Highly recommend
3430,Had a procedure under general anaesthetic on Tuesday I was very apprehensive but all the staff in the ward And recovery and the anethasists were brilliant and I have such appreciation for Doctor Gooding who carried out the procedure .Because of the covid virus I was worried about going in but the social distancing and hygiene was first class. Thank you .
7178,"On #InternationalNursesDay I'd like to give a shout out to all the wonderful breast care nurses @YorkTeachingNHS, but especially Lizzie & Andrea. I couldn't have done without them during my treatment. They were definitely the crutch to hold me up and the voices of reason üíú"
3915,I thought the service was fantastic 10out of 10
6672,Score 2 for service from doctor (Dr Tami) who was very kind and thorough despite being very busy and stretched on Weds night but didnt give me antibiotics which I needed for finger wound. I eventually got prescribed these by duty doctor in Minor Injuries clinic at Haslemere hospital on Sat morning - organised by 111 service which was very good.Score 5 for overall experience due to a 7 hour wait in royal Surrey A&E which was very miserable.
3466,"Covid vaccination centre shambles - Called for and booked an appt at this centre had to travel over 19 miles each way as nearest one to us. Left standing in extremely long queues outside freezing, many elderly patients having to stand on crutches. Just awful never again! "
8471,"Highly recommended, exceptional care, fantastic staff."
4605,"The other half has spent the day in A&E @SFHFT Kingsmill. He's full of praise for his care, the tests they ran were quick and everything explained reassuringly. He said he was treated and seen by 4 staff, all from oversees and his Spanish Doctor was amazing. #bigupNHS"
364,Urgent Treatment Centre - Fantastic care - All the department and staff were fantastic. Thank you so much for the out standing care I received from various department
1788,Care provided was excellent and staff were friendly. I felt I was treated with confident care and compassion.
7041,Compassion
9770,Ward 43 only looked after my 98 year old dad for 4 days. As he was covid positive he was not expected to pull through. However he was treated with care and dignity and time was taken to explain what was happening. Special thanks to Catherine and Richard who made it possible for us to visit and answer our questions. This was so appreciated as 3 hours later he was gone. Thank you to all ward 43 staff for your selfless care
76,"RSCH have served my self and my family so well for years. Amazing staff, very lucky to have this hospital in Guildford Surrey. Wonderful new Early pregnancy unit on my recent trip there. Kind caring staff and very quick to be seen."
188,"I got a ring stuck on my finger which swelled uncomfortably to the point it needed cutting off. I went to the urgencies area and they said the waiting time was 2 hours. I was in and out within 20 minutes, all of the staff were brilliant and cheerful. Thank you so much! "
3405,The consultant Mr Tim Worthington showed no interest in my case. He was looking at old scans (12 months)which could have changed as I have had surgery. He was totally not interested and just said he would refer to the pain team which is a total waste of time. He was quite happy for me to be on morphine for the foreseeable future. I was totally dismayed when I left his office. Just not fair !
8427,"The area was clean and tidy. The staff were friendly, put me at ease. I was dealt with quickly. My questions were answered fully. I have a great deal of respect for the staff who work under often difficult circumstances."
2022,Don't know - Excellent service in MRI - My son needed an MRI scan today. Wow what an incredibly well organised service and the staff were all super friendly. We were in and out within 20 mins. thankyou so much everyone in MRI
3057,This place has turned into a place to die rather than staff making you better. If you can buy private healthcare DO IT!! Its a MORGUE.
8773,Really professional and caring treatment today at MUDAS @BucksHealthcare @NMacdonaldBHT Thoroughly recommend the service. Thank you for referring me @docsihasan @HelenHelenmehra
5069,"Bariatric surgery - Fantastic staff / treatment - I received gastric bypass surgery in September and was admitted to priestly ward, every member of staff including surgeons nurses and cleaners were all amazing and I cannot praise them enough, even with how busy they all are nothing was too much and I cannot thank them enough! "
4256,"Most welcoming and efficient - I would like to commend the receptionist at the Phlebotomy Dept at St Mary's Hospital. She was most welcoming and efficient, checking on the period of fasting. Reception staff provide a valuable service in signposting patients and assisting with their care pathway."
4170,"Ophthalmology - Unnecessary eye surgery that led to difficulties - I was convinced that doing a lens replacement surgery would cure my blurred vision. I trusted the surgeon who told me this even though I hadn't requested any surgery. I had only attended for uveitis in the past. Post-surgery, I noticed nothing changed, but I'd lost the short vision I had with no improvement and gained double vision. I signed the consent form based on what I was told and not once did anyone tell me the surgery wouldn't fix my vision. I'm an educated woman. If I was told the truth, I would never have consented to such a waste of my time and costly mistake on the surgeon's part. I can't tell if she has acted in bad faith, but I will bring this up if my eye doesn't return to normal. In short, she convinced me she could get my vision to the point of seeing without glasses only to tell me post-surgery that I had amblyopia from childhood and it wasn't going to change. If I could post her name up here to warn people, I would, but I think it's best to make a report so the NHS improves guidelines. She never felt the need to apologise for misleading me, which is a shame. I only agreed to it because I had respect for her, which is now gone. Always get second opinions. I wish I had. I've now since been told by 2 optometrists that lens exchange surgery is never recommended for people with amblyopia."
1852,100 times 1!! | 100 times 1!! | Perfect!!
5834,"I was the earliest appointment (8:30) and on arrival the waiting room was empty. Despite that, after tests and scans, there was an hours wait to see the doctor. The sign even suggested that the wait might be three hours. This is an organisational issue and is not acceptable. The same doctors in private practice would not countenance this. | And why send messages saying do not arrive too early if you then hold us for three hours?"
4906,Accident and emergency services - Children's ED - Fast and kind care from reception to triage and then MEDDOC. Both departments busy but there for us when we needed them.
7275,It's a hospital... Car park could be bigger and fair prices but that's how they all are. The traffic and road system near the hospital is out of date and needs updating to reflect how much bigger and busier the hospital is against when the place was originally built.
3441,"Wife had to go for A&E after having severe stomach pains. Went there, had to wait two hours to finally be seen. When I say seen I mean wait a further 7 hours for nothing to be done, other than 3 urine samples and 3 blood sample, with only a nurse being able to actually see my wife and to tell her that she has an infection from a blood test. Was told that the doctor would only be able to help her, 3-4 hours later. Let's add that up, that would be 12-13 hours to actually get any real help. We decided to give up, completely useless hospital. Avoid this hospital. Avoid."
7444,
2593,Accident and emergency services - Excellent care and treatment - After receiving swift help from SW Ambulance service my elderly mother was given immediate attention and head CT scan. The stroke consultant was present to give immediate diagnosis and treatment. Care was superb and communication with me was first class. Staff team work was excellent and efficient including an agency nurse. Staff were kind and caring including considering my own well - being. Thank you. It is so reassuring during these challenging times that the NHS team continue to provide an excellent service for all. It is particularly impressive that working conditions are challenging in A and E with the building improvements being carried out simultaneously.

323,"Hello @GSTTnhs @GSTTresearch, just wanted to say a big thank you to your amazing team at the Seal CRF at St Thomas' Hospital for looking after Baby R today. Especially Nurses Sophie, Helen & Gary, Dr Marta & Prof George Du Toit. You are all amazing! "
7815,"I cannot thank WHH enough for saving my life. Without their expertise, fast acting decisions and total commitment to patient wellness, I don't believe I'd have been around to celebrate my first wedding anniversary. I'm a Covid-19 survivor after spending a very scary time in ICU / ITU where I was placed in a medical coma in order to give my lungs a chance to recover from the pneumonia. I put it down to the team of remarkable people who looked after me, in conjunction with my incredible family and friends (who were encouraged by the team to keep calling and talking to me even if I wasn't awake) who kept me alive. Thank you for everything. Then Cambridge ward looked after me after ITU and they were incredible in their patience and care. Such compassion shown because when you come out of the situation I was in, it is terrifying and they totally acknowledged that and helped me through every anxious moment."
2490,"Ophthalmology - Professional Service - I was referred to William Harvey for a detached retina repair. Assessment of the damage was carried out on a Tuesday and a space made available for the operation on the Thursday. The outpatient surgical waiting area was busy but the staff were efficient and friendly despite their workload. There was a delay between my appointment time and the actual operation but that was to be expected given the patient throughput. The consultant and her team carrying out the procedure were professional, friendly and informative throughout despite a last minute change from a general anaesthetic to a local one and the need to brief me on what I was going to experience. I was moved from theatre to the Rotary Ward for discharge and despite my last minute arrival the staff made me welcome and briefed me clearly on what I needed to do during the following weeks of recovery. A good job by all concerned."
1603,1 Very Good | The care I had was excellent the nurses were brilliant.
2497,Seen on time. Consultant very attentive and listened to any concerns I had. Didnt feel rushed. Very reassuring but in an evidence based way. Felt adjusted consultation to my personal requirements.

4350,"NHS workers should be given UK citizenship as well as protection. Foreign medical staff are risking their lives for British people, writes Dr Gill Sare, while David Jones asks if employees deprived of PPE will be able to seek redress through the courts.. For many years the NHS has relied on thousands of staff who are EU and other nationals to support our wonderful but ailing healthcare system. It can be a tough place to work at the best of times and, unfortunately, Brexit made ...many of them feel unwelcome and unappreciated. The situation has now drastically changed. NHS workers are being asked to risk their lives to care for the British people during the Covid-19 outbreak. We have already lost colleagues and we will lose more.. For many of us, we are being asked to take care of our own people, the British people. However, for our colleagues who come from other countries, we are asking them to risk their lives to look after citizens of a country that has not been welcoming in recent times. Their families are far away, and many are also at risk or sick, yet they stay to help us.. The government suggests that it will give leave to remain for one year to foreign nationals working in our healthcare system. This is insulting; it suggests that they will work through Covid-19 and may not be welcome afterwards. It is time for the government and the British people to recognise the risks and the (literally) lifesaving contribution NHS staff from other countries are making. We must go much further than leave to remain. It is time for all of them to be given automatic UK citizenship in recognition of their sacrifice.. It is time for us to make them the British people too. Please sign my petition at www.tinyurl.com / NHScitizens. Dr Gill Sare Nottingham. Give NHS workers who are EU and other Nationals automatic UK citizenship if they stay and risk their own lives looking after the British people during the COVID crisis.. About This Website PETITION.PARLIAMENT.UK Petition: Give non-British citizens who are NHS workers automatic citizenship Give NHS workers who are EU and other Nationals automatic UK citizenship if they stay and risk their own lives looking after the British people during the COVID crisis."

So professional but always time for a kind word and nothing too much trouble. So clean, excellent food, nothing at all could have been better. Thank you"
6229,Just been to my mini #Renal appt to have my bloods done. Im told a few transplant patients are worried about attending. Plz go it's VERY important you have your bloods checked. 2 amazing NHS staff on duty doing a wonderful job. #NHS #StaySafe @SalfordRoyalNHS @kidneycareuk @nkf
552,Thank you to @RJAH_NHS and @sathNHS for the amazing care I had from both hospitals after this happened in July. There really aren't words to say how brilliantly I was cared for. So grateful. #thankyounhs https://t.co/7FoP9Edu8X
3700,"Would love to give this hospital 5 stars as the Doctor / Ambulance staff was lovely & caring. But the Front of House Admin / Staff were rude to all patients. I only saw 1 sided rudeness & it was fromNHS FOHouse Staff especially the front of house man in blue overalls (filipino looking w / Long plait, glasses) who was so patronising & making insensitive comments to people who were arriving, the staff were even rude to Police who came in & were very polite to the NHS staff. Girl at reception this morning Sunday 8th Circa the early hours of 0100 hours - was extremely rude & had zero empathy. She needs to be careful as theres alot of super experienced people with people skills out there looking for jobs that will snatch it from under her. During these times you would think there would be more kindness & understanding. I understand they are under pressure but all the patients that were coming were being courteous so why are they so angry. I was just praying their match would not come in as there would be problems & delay the waiting room."
4479,"Accident and emergency services - Awesome A&E Nurse - I sprained my ankle badly, and went to A&E at Whipps to make sure it wasn't anything worse. The wait to be seen was surprisingly short, and I got seen by the same nurse who treated me when I cut my finger badly last year. Both his manner and expertise were exemplary, and made the whole experience much better than I'd expected it to be; Whipps Cross should be very proud to have him on the team. Sam"
2938,I got there half hour early and called in after 5 minutes which is p | Waited 5 mins and was called in i was half hour early so impressed mind u its never happened before
2522,Maternity services - Terrible service - I was ment to have a scan at 10 am but didnt get seen until 10:45 am. I was then told by the person doing the scan one thing but when the doctor came to review me they said something completely different. While waiting for a scan I was witnessing some extremely concerning thing such as a doctors office door was left open for everyone in the waiting room to see confidential information on the computer screen. Also staff standing around and talking the WhatsApp group they have and the information they share on it. And lastly with the current COVID 19 pandemic people are ment to wear face coverings within hospitals and then in close contact with others however this doesnt seem to apply to the staff. Even though they are quick to tell you to put one on lead by example I say. The service I have recieved today was very concerning and I will be informing as many people as I can about what I have witnessed this will include local authorites if I have to.
3695,Good service from excellent staff. Well Done to you all.
3908,"My continuing health issues - My story began in 2004 after suffering a massive heart attack, followed by a cardiac arrest 4 months later. My health has been deteriorating ever since suffering from various different ailments. I have had many years of using this service I cannot praise it enough. The provision of expert care and advice is second to none"
3886,My appointment was on time. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. The hospital felt clean and had a lovely atmosphere.
6410,"I want to thank all the people who work inside the hospital, especially the three Italian girls in particular who helped me a lot, they were angels for me Camilla Mara and the other girl I don't remember the name they work in an emergency thanks you really are heroes üåàüåàXhilda"
8484,"On the first visit around 6.30 pm staff were all very nice and we were seen within a couple of hours. The wound was dressed and we were told to come back in 48 hours for it to be checked which we did. On arrival at 7pm today the receptionist told us, quite coldly, that they don't do dressings after 6pm. I explained we had been told to return. She let us in and we waited to see the nurse, only then to be told the same again. Having rushed home from work to accompany my son, who was told not to walk due to injury, and spending 12.50 in taxi fares, it would have been helpful to be advised of this in the first instance. With notice we could easily have gone earlier in the day. Hopefully the wound will be ok when they do check it tomorrow! "
3811,Surprisingly appalling service in A&E lead by unprofessional youngsters who you need constantly remind to request for something you need or you'll be forgotten. Been waiting for 5+ hours for father to at least get some treatment. If you don't ask you would be ignored by the majority. These assistant nurses can be so rude too.
5195,Waiting for 5 hours on primary care with 15 months old baby with high fever. Nightmare
8097,"Haematology - Superb. - Just back from an appointment, and I have to say, I have no complaints whatsoever. All the nurses I saw, were friendly, helpful, and had smiles on their faces. I was well looked after, and despite being a somewhat difficult patient, (health reasons), one member of staff, went out of their way, to make sure I was OK. Really impressed, and definitely feel confident and safe about my visit."
5705,"I came in for a hip replacement and found the service I received at each stage very good. I was kept fully informed of each step, all clearly explained. The facilities were good and the staff very helpful and friendly. I was out in less than 36 hrs but at no time did I feel I was being rushed through the system."
7329,"Dear @NHSuk, @NHSEngland, @nhsuhcw; Are you aware that: 1. my wife's GP can't see all of the data from her A&E visits; 2. the after-hours GP to which her GP referred her can't see all of the data her GP has about her; 3. paramedics can't see much of her data? Seems risky to me."
2767,Efficient NHS emergency hospital with extensive out patient services.
2417,Professional and organised.
6680,"Our experience its been awful, doctors say one thing they do and order the nurses to do.something different. The nurses don't do their job, you ask hundred times and they just don't do it, I regret having come here for Child emergency."

2531,"Accident and emergency services - Very good - I would like to thank all the staff on A and E at 2.20am on wednesday 19th february 2020 Brian came on the ward with a chest and urine infection. He has a diagnosis of prostate and bone cancer. Within minutes of being admitted Brian had fluids in place as he was dehydrated. Bloods were taken, which identified he would need a blood trasfussion. And within 2 hours he had been sent for a chest x-ray. The staff are under so much pressure but they were fantastic on this night. We were lucky there was a bed on medical assessment unit. Again the care was good. Brian is now on Dixon ward where the good care continues. Thanks so much to all the staff for there ongoing care that Brian has received since being diagnosed with cancer."
584,"Today we had an appointment to the Hospital, by the entrance they haven't let us in because they've told us that only 1 parent can go in with the child (which wasn't the problem), so i've stayed by the entrance to wait for them to come back out, after a few minutes another family came and they've let all of them inside, the receptionist came up to me asking if eveythong's ok?! I have explainedher thati wasn't allowed in while others can all go in, then she told me that who's got 2 kids then 2 parents can go it, but they only had 1 kid with them as i have explained ot to her aswell, then she tried to kick us out by told the security guard to do something about us, i have explained to the security guard aswell that what has happened, he hasn't done anything, then after that the receptionist came back saying that we don't have a mask on aswell etc (but she wasn'tbothered about it for like an hour as i stood there for an hour waitingwith no mask on), shame on the receptionist, is it a problem for her that were not from here?! Is this all because of were not from here? The security guard was fine, while the receptionist were an idiot...Rules should be followed by everyone, and should not treat other different because they're not from the UK, i don't looking for explanations, today was enough..."

7406,"Plastic surgery - friendly, helpful and informative - I attended the day surgery centre as a day patient to have a lipoma removed from my arm. All the staff were extremely helpful and informative, polite and friendly. Any questions and anxieties were addressed by the staff and the theatre staff talked me through my options as regards anaesthetic and advised me which would be best for me. This reassured me and removed what anxieties i was feeling. Everything went exactly as they said it would and i left the unit feeling extremely happy about the whole experience. I would recommend this unit and it's wonderful staff. MANY THANK'S"

Firstly that person discriminate smokers (I know very well how bad there's for health) but everyone had free choice, this same a like we choice religion, sexual orientation. Secondly and more important, if you want smoke you have to walk around 1000 feet outside premises, people with different health problems, difficulties to walk, after surgeries need walk that distance and cross two road. There's really huge risk and dangerous for this people, even now when it's cold and icy. I will be understood if this restriction was from begin but they was designed areas for smoking (still they're just can't be used).Only one day that person wake up and decided make live smokers more harder."

5141,"Maternity services - No Safety Rules Observed During Pandemic - I had an appointment with the Antenatal Clinic today and I came back home with great concerns as to the safety of my visit as we are in the middle of the pandemic and I could see that wearing masks for patients seemed to be discretionary, the very doctor who saw me was not wearing a mask and she was sitting very close to me while performing a scan, there were outside workers in the building wearing no masks. My partner waited for me in the parking lot for 1, 5 hours as we understandably respected the strict policy of no accompanying partner during visits, however one of the patients was accompanied by her mother and another lady brought in her husband all the way to the second floor (no mask) and no one seemed to mind - this makes the ones who do respect rules look like idiots. Not only am I vulnerable as pregnant, I also live with someone even more vulnerable than I am and it simply feels so wrong to think of my visits in the Maternity Unit as something that could pose a risk to myself and my family. Please treat this seriously as this is not just about one random patient, it's about all of us who come there to be helped and should feel 100 percent safe. "
7491,Went today for an endoscopy staff very friendly explained everything what they were going to do got seen with in half an hour excellent service

From the moment I was met at the door, to the time I left, everyone was professional, kind and supportive. Please pass on my thanks to all the wonderful staff, their care and dedication is hugely appreciated."
9552,"Abrupt staff lacking in empathy - I was incorrectly sign posted to the wrong CMHT branch in a neighbouring borough over at The Mount, Accrington. In my attempts to navigate my way around this error I spoke with a member of the team and became quite distressed, stating that I was happy to attend The Mount rather than my nearest clinic if it was going to be more straight forward for me and I stated that I had friends in a similar situation with this postcode error. The member of staff I spoke to was very abrupt, accused me of speaking over them several times without the staff member actually letting me finish what I had to say first and then they went on to put the telephone down on me. I was left very angry and disappointed and I would suggest that this member of staff would perhaps benefit from some further training as I feel it was very inappropriate to hang up on me; particularly when I wasn't actually getting a chance to finish expressing my points before being acccused of talking over the staff member, whom I presume is employed to listen to the service user."

3883,
3061,Hugely disappointing to hear my Mums chemotherapy @Weston_Park @SheffieldHosp has been deferred due to staffing less than 24 hours before her appointment to have a picc line. Last real chance to give just a few more months of life. I guess this is the real impact of #Covid_19
4414,Very professional and positive. Helpful advice.
7209,Several attendances over last year....staff excellent and efficient. No wait and great care. Thank you x
3040,"Orthopaedics - Great professional staff - I had a knee arthroscopy as a day surgery, all the staff that I met that day were professional and friendly. I was extremely anxious and all through the process my mind was put at ease. My only negative is the nurse in the recovery room told me I hadn't had any surgery done but just a bit of flushing here (she pointed to a picture) I was groggy so I have no idea what she said and felt puzzled that my knee was swollen and sore if I had had nothing done. She was also determined that I didn't go back to my room but to the day unit, who were surprised as they had men recovering there and none from orthopaedic. I felt confused as I was expecting to go back to my room the nurse made me feel like I had no say in any thing. In the end because I didn't go back to my room it wasted other members of staffs time trying to find my phone which was in a drawer in my room. The day unit were wonderful and almost slightly apologetic I was there amongst all the men. Apart from this one thing the service was amazing. I have had to be a QA quite a few times over the years for Neuro and orthpeadiac I have always been impressed with the service they give."
1793,Waiting time in A&E - Was feeling very unwell and having a five hour wait to see a doctor did not help at all only to be sent back to A&E for a further wait to have blood tests and see yet another doctor . No wonder my bp was over 200 by the time I got to see a doctor .

6085,"I first saw Mr Modi following a referral from my optician who thought my eyelids should be raised. Although Mr Modi was professional, he was pleasant and friendly. He explained that my brow as well as my eyelids needed raising, told me of the options that could be done and we decided on a procedure. The day of the operation, I was naturally nervous but Mr Modi kindly put me at ease explaining again what he would be doing and that I would have a light general anesthetic. The operation went well and I am extremely pleased with the result, my vision is so much better, scars are very neat and hardly showing, following the line of my eyebrows perfectly. Follow up appointments with Mr Modi have been regular and thorough, but made a better by seeing such a personable consultant.."

Family have been waiting seven hours for her to arrive but the ambulance went to the wrong address so they cancelled my mum's drop and have taken her back to hospital. Last time she was discharged they took her to the wrong address; shouldn't be surprised as they keep getting her name wrong. Total shambles, an excuse of a hospital."

6560,Do not answer phones ... The worst ... ESP when trying to speak to .. about ... Patients ... Potentially for the last time ... Dire
5355,What a fucking joke. Went to Charing Cross hospital with my transgender brother for his doctors appointment to see someone at the breast screening clinic to sort out his top surgery. The doctor had the audacity to question why he was here and to suggest that he didn't need to be.

Then taken to have a CT scan and subsequently to a nurse for ECG and bloods. All done by 11:15 - excellent. Was told blood test would take 1.5 hours - in the meantime saw senior nurse who gave me the all clear pending blood results - all done by 12:30. Brilliant service. Minor issue on the down side - blood results were not available by 2:00pm by which time due to the excessive heat in the waiting room, water machine broken and queue forming for new patients decided I would leave and telephone later for blood results. Excellent news - the senior nurse telephoned me on my way home to confirm blood results were OK. Overall I received a first class service and in view of the tests / scans well worth the wait to see various trained nurses. At all times the nurses were polite professional and very helpful. I cannot praise them enough and thanks them for their kind attention."

Having had a very bad blood test experience in another department of the hospital a year ago, I was very nervous about this. The great news is that my blood test today, carried out by a young man in cubicle 3, was excellent. A completely different experience and very professional, so thank you.

9915,"I called them before i walked in, to know if it's the right place to go with my problem. The receptionist was really nice and helpful. I waited like 20 mins, before i got in. The lady (nurse or doc) she was nice too, gave some advice, helped a lot. There were hand sanitizer all over the place, the chairs were cleaned often."
9463,Very Helpful - I was very nervous when I first attended but was put at ease by the friendly and understanding staff. My sessions helped me understand the root of my problems and the options available to me to help make things better. Strangely COVID-19 helped to reduce my stress to a level where I felt comfortable to complete my Therapy but I would have no problem approaching this service again should things get worse.

Anytime in hospital is a trying time and without visitors but this time I did not think about visitation because of the attention I received, the nurses the consultant, anaesthetist all need mention. A very happy crew which they managed to pass on to their patients. They should be commended. "
5968,"Hysteroscopy Suite Experience - I attended the hysteroscopy suite at Wharfedale Hospital last week and the experience was fantastic from start to finish. The hospital has a nice calm environment and it was quiet in the department. The doctor that I spoke to was very kind and compassionate and put me at ease. She spent time explaining everything to me and allowing me to ask any questions and understand the procedure and all my options. During the procedure there were a couple of nurses with the doctor and a care assistant who stood next to me and reassured me throughout. The doctor explained what she was doing and talked to me which really helped keep me calm. I was given a cup of tea and time to sit and relax after the procedure. The doctor then talked through everything with me and explained the next steps and what my options were. I left feeling fully informed and having been treated with the utmost kindness, care and compassion."
3022,"Catering Department Staff behavior is disgraceful! I have been admitted and treated as a COVID patient as since 26.09.2021. Initially i was on Ward Purley 3 due my health got deteriorated they have transferred me to Duppas 1. On both words its covering shift's for a few days one of the same Catering Assistant from Chinese Background as i don't know her name . She is extremely rude, uncaring and her service is very poor . When i have express choice of my diet as i can have only certain food her answer was i cant serve you with the restaurant food or i will call my manager and request from him. This is not acceptable answer . When i have asked to push me the side table with the tray with food what she have served, she have answer that is not her job?! I believe her manager should give a proper job training as i believe she don't follow her job description. Catering department seriously should look in to their staff which provides services for the patients, as there Servers are not at all providing professional and caring services towards the patient. Their behavior is disgraceful . Do not mention their cutlery's where there never polished, or service without salt, or dirty trays . Hot drinks are very rare and the attitude is very arrogant and disappointment ."

Then my wife has been admits but the problem starts therefore no time limit they'll put you in the queue so you can't ask for your position in the queue and the people are coming and going but don't know what's going on. Incase you asking for queue position they will mind it why you asking. After longtime you can go to the labour ward which is more dangerous even they no have time. If you go to the labour ward which i explained before like as normal patient then you have 15 hours waiting time in labour ward cause the other patients had emergency and you no i was very rude with dr cause they're mean 4 to 5 persons who are try to broke the water after long time they broke the water. I was wait with my wife in labour ward for six hours nobody comes to see my wife whats going on in this time when ask for dr to see my wife she was very rude with me. In oder she say if rising your voice you should leave the ward. In this case what should I do üòåüòåüòå

I've complained before about certain members of staff there but still they have no respect for patients that need a carer with them, people who are autistic don't need to be treated like they are five years old or be spoken to rudely. They need someone w...ith them to help them when they panick etc, Hospital staff should know this and not treat them like they are a child, We all know what's going on in the world we don't need a door staff person to preach this to us, A prisoner has four prison officers attend the hospital with them and door staff don't batter an eyelid, Yet let you be a woman with your Autistic adult Daughter and they give you hell on the door.

Despite A&E being very busy I was seen quite quickly and within two hours had had an ECG and had been referred on to Clinic 5 Ambulatory where I received excellent service - a chest x-ray, blood tests and a further ECG. My condition was subsequently diagnosed as AF and I had an excellent meeting with a doctor who took a lot of time to explain things to me and I left with appropriate medication. The end to end time was under 4 hours which I think for an unscheduled visit at a challenging time for the hospital was excellent. I'd like to express my thanks to the A&E team who took my concerns seriously when they were surrounded by many clearly ill and injured patients, and to the ‚Äòclinic 5' team who were extremely supportive and helpful. It's easy to criticise when things go wrong but important to give praise when things go well. Thank you. "

I phoned the ward and they assured it was normal and should stop by the morning which it did. Please tell future patients and give sufficient dressings to cope with potentially a lot of fluid."

That must have been a constant problem with many people arriving up to an hour late or an hour early - so should you make the early arrivals wait for their allotted time and send the late arrivals home? Certainly not! Some genius found a simple and practical solution. As we arrived in the Vaccination Hall we were met by the lady with the obligatory clipboard, who presumably checked to see that our names were there - we mentioned our allotted time, but that wasn't necessary - and we were given a number on a paper. Essentially we were placed in a consecutively numbered queue in the order we arrived, and told to listen for our number. SIMPLE, VERY EFFECTIVE AND SEEN TO BE FAIR! "

3721,"Diagnostic Endoscopy - Endoscopy Unit - I had my endoscopy and colonoscopy today, I was very nervous but all the staff were amazing from being booked in to the actual procedure, I just want to say a big thank you for being so caring and understanding for looking after me, highly recommended."
9291,"Same story every time, 10 staff member in one room sitting, drinking coffe, talking and laughing. When you ask them for anything they look at you like you are just a bug and answering that have no time, or someone will be with you in a minute. Than you wait 6h..... Clearly broken system in need of privatization."
3217,"1st vaccine done. Huge thanks to the very efficient @enherts 400 people a day going through the doors. Staff doing a brilliant job, some on their days off @HPFT_NHS #vaccine #COVIDVaccination #COVID19"
1799,"Giving 1 star as there are some helpful staff here. Today went in for an ultrasound of a very intimate area. Walked into the tiny room, which needs a clean by the way and the radiologist didn't even turn around to look at me and say hello. She and her assistant were talking about one of their colleagues while I was changing behind the curtain. Then barking orders at me for how to sit but not explaining clearly. It was just one of the most awkward experiences I have had. Do they not understand how people might be feeling? How traumatic it can be for a woman to have this sort of scan. The very least you can do is introduce yourself to the patient and explain what will happen. Perhaps time to switch to private healthcare for me! "
4560,A very private & personal service
8026,Inappropriate question - My partner has just been for his COVID vaccine & been asked if he is British before he could have the vaccine. He is a British citizen but born in Turkey. He feels very upset & has never felt so victimised. Is this asked of every one getting a vaccine when they have an appointment made through their doctor. In 50 years in this country he has never before felt so uncomfortable with such a question 
1398,Extremely professional - My husband has just returned from the respiratory clinic. He was treated with the upmost care and respect. Both members of staff were thorough and extremely helpful explaining everything clearly and precisely. Thank you for a first class service.

7546,Accident and emergency services - Excellent service in A&E - The care we received from every member of staff we met in the A& E department last Friday night was exceptional. Everyone from the ambulance team and nurses to the A&E doctors and security staff were all friendly and very professional and provided the highest level of care. Thank you to a wonderful team.

7804,"Gynaecology - Lack of professionalism and care for their patients. - I have been started on a treatment journey since August 2020. Since then I had my appointments canceled, rescheduled on the last minute. When I have attended to scheduled appointments I had to wait once nearly two hours! Two days ago I had a voice mail message informing me that my consultant appointment scheduled for today 3rd December at 4PM now would be a virtual one. It is now 16:45 hours and again they let me down. No call. No appointment. No care. I am here since Agust waiting for answers and treatment. I am a health care profession working everyday on the front line seeing patients and would not dare to let my patients without answers to their concerns and treatment. I am very disappointed and feeling rather upset for have been messed up so much. "

They made me feel so at ease and gave her 10/10 care. You are such fantastic people, doing what you do and thank you for everything you did for her. It could have been a totally different outcome had you not acted so quickly."
6872,kind caring compassionate staff

2526,"Don't know - Unfairly treated - Recently went to fracture clinic at Chorley Hospital with a booked appointment time, had to wait 2 hours to be seen by a dr. In between the 2hours of waiting when enquired with the receptionist how long its going to be she said for me to go and ask the nurse. When ask the nurse she said we had some urgent cases today so we had to let them go in before you. Unhappy with the service I just sat back down in waiting area again waiting and waiting, I noticed that people whose appointment time was after mine were being seen to before me, new people were coming in and were being seen to before i was. It eventually came to the point I was the only one left at the clinic waiting area still waiting to be seen - it felt like they only eventually saw me because there was nobody else left to call for. I was appalled by the service I was given & felt I was hugely unfairley treated. I personally believe the files system should be replaced by a number / ticket system so people exactly know when their turn is next and to potentially prevent any kind of unfair treatment of patients like myself."
1062,"The staff are impeccable, friendly and helpful. The nurses are fantastic. The Royal Surrey is the best hospital around. Especially for disabled patients now youve painted the dropped curbs red and smoothed them out a bit. They certainly tip my wheelchair about."
6217,"So my Aunty had a heart attack on Saturday. She's recovering now, thanks to an army of call handlers, paramedics, doctors, nurses, porters, consultantsand radiologists at Manchester Royal Infirmary. Quite simply, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you."

7024,"Attentive, informative and understanding, evident on all visits."
1005,"They don't treat patients any more, they treat bed numbers and they get these mixed up. Ward nurses change pretty much every day so there is no knowledge of nor rapport with the patient, so the subulties of care are lost. You're lucky if you see the same doctor twice. All in all the 5 days I spent were frustrating and unpleasant. I was discharged (what farce that was) cured of what caused me to be there so reluctantly I have given the one star. If I am ill in future I'd rather go to my local vet"
2365,2 hospital stays in 4 weeks! - I've spent the 4 weeks from May to June on 2 different wards at Newcastle-upon-Tyne Royal Victoria Infirmary. Taken in with severe abdominal pain - diagnosed as a Perforated Diverticulitis. Cared for brilliantly on Ward 46. Discharged after two weeks. The next day I had to ring 999 due to excruciating hip pain. Had to crawl from my bed to front door to let paramedics in. Given Morphine injection and taken straight to the hospital. Diagnosed with severe Osteoarthritis Flare-Up - pain was 15+ on 0-10 scale. Excellent treatment in admissions suite and then on Ward 42. Staff on 42 were wonderful. The only problem was with my discharge from W42 on 2nd. I was just told Your transport is here and here is your medication. No instructions on how to take my new medications - especially as I am now on Morphine Sulphate tablets and liquid Oramorph. I was also supposed to be seen by Pain Management Team whilst in hospital but I wasn't.
3716,"Ear, Nose & Throat - More understanding of autism is drasticly needed - I had a very bad time at this hospital today. I tried to make sure nothing bad happened through lack of communication. I phoned up which I don't find easy so I could give advanced exlplantion that I struggle with understsnding things and being around people. I was told they would put that in my notes but they didn't. The people I saw had no idea how to deal with me. No one told me they were going to put some kind of camera down my throat I thought I was having a hearing test. Due to being autistic which is in my brain and I can't change I can't cope when they don't have the right crisps in stock so clearly when I think I'm there for a hearing test and they start talking about doing something completly different my brain doesn't accept it. It was an urgent appointment and I left without getting anything done because I couldn't cope with the situation and now I'm too scared to come back because I felt like no one had time to explain anything about what was happening to me. I am grateful for our hospitals I know I am very lucky and I don't want donald trump to steal them. But I have a develpmentle dissorder that makes me not be able to control my thinking and behaviour like normal people. You made me feel like rick in no way out when jessie got eaten by walkers and he had to chop her hand off then carl got shot in the eye. That is the best way I can express myself because I can't describe my emotions. "
4238,Such a friendly nurse who left no stone unturned
5465,"Oh thanks @LandDHospital or whoever is behind patient transport. My mum has had transport for years.. she getting worse and she goes out in a wheelchair but you've now decided since she can get in a car.. from out of the wheelchair, you're denying her access to transport."
5450,"I was recently in your a+e department as I had been brought in by ambulance, can I just say how excellent all your staff are, I was so embarrassed to how I ended up there, but everyone was amazing so thank u all so much, "
8744,Worst Hospital in the country. Honestly. I respect NHS staff so much and I believe they do a great job but this place is honestly disgusting. The staff are rude and have no care for patients and families! If you have a family member check into A&E good luck finding out how they are or what's going on! The staff act as if it's not their problem that you don't know how your family member is despite the fact they don't have a phone. Really disappointing the NHS this place. Gives hospitals and staff a bad name. If you ever need to go to hospital I emplore you try anything you can to visit a different one. Avoid at all costs!!

Top marks there!Whilst the Covid-19 check on entry is understandable, it adds an extra layer to registration that is inefficient. There is 1) Covid-19 2) General reception 3) Triage. And some details provided 3 times (and much more than just confirming ID) I have some understanding of queuing theory. You could cut down your waiting times considerably and report a better performance by some considered thought on this process with relevant details (other than confirming ID) jus"

648,"Accident and emergency services - Amazing staff - Our mother was taken to the hospital after collapsing at my sisters home on 12/1/2020. The ambulance teams were brilliant. Mum had a serious brain bleed and to our absolute horror was pronounced brain dead within a couple of hours.. The staff who looked after us (please look at the rota) .. Were amazing so caring and professional they keep us informed with everything they were doing. We offered mum for transplant as that's what she would have wanted. We spoke to an amazing lady from the transport team who again discussed everything with us and kept us informed of all the steps along the way. Mum unfortunately was not a candidate for transplant so the decision after again much care and support was made to withdraw life support.. The team moved mum to a side room with great dignity and privacy so that we could be with her and let her go in peace. With great compassion the wonderful nurses removed the life support talking to mum and us all the time. They then left us to say our goodbyes. The care and compassion that the team and the ambulance team (who came to see us when they returned throughout the day, ) was unbelievable and the whole family would like to thank them from the bottom of our hearts. It is so easy to complain about the care that is given but yet again the William Harvey and the NHS has stepped up to the mark and we commend them. Thank you all "
7879,"I visited the a&e as I was suffering an early pregnancy miscarriage. I appreciate everything that the NHS staff did for me on that horrible day. After the doctor removed the sac from my womb, he said I will arrange a scan for you to see if there's anything left. Until then, the pregnancy is not over. You might still be pregnant, so let's stay positive. If he had stabbed me, it wouldn't have hurt that much. Why would a doctor say that to a mother who has just miscarried? Unless he could make that little sac have a heartbeat again and put it back into me, which I'd love. The same doctor said that I could start trying again on that same night when he knew that I was bleeding. He also called my pregnancy a spot of blood. Tell your doctor the spot of blood is no longer in me but I will always grieve. Waited 3 hours for the scan results. Again, I am grateful for all the doctors and nurses' efforts but a little empathy goes a long way. Your doctor should have shown more compassion. I have to say though, I visited the a&e on another occasion for my sick son, so I went to the children's ward and they were all exceptional."
775,"The doctors, nurses and consultants were very thorough, kind and professional throughout my examination and treatment and everything was explained in a clear and compassionate way."
9342,The members of staff that dealt with my issues were perfect!!! Thank you so much for your help! 
7228,Inpatient mental health services - Please sort out the WiFi - The lack of a WiFi signal on both Haven and Harbour Ward is extremely frustrating and affecting my ability to maintain contact with my son. I am unable to visit him due to Covid-19 restrictions so the only way we can communicate is via his iPad or iPhone. However with no WiFi and no mobile signal on both wards this is not possible. Now more than ever the WiFi needs to get sorted so patients can communicate with their loved ones.
6439,"Your service was excellent, the nurse that carried out tests Elaine was fantastic, a great credit to the NHS, she needs a personal thank you."
9965,the staff even when there were some hiccups such a a minor communication issues the nurses and health care assistant on the ward met with grace and understanding

6687,In 2013 I was rushed in here after a leg infection from a previous operation resurfaced after five years . The doctors here warned me that they might amputate. I declined to sign the consent form and asked to be transferred to the Northern General in Sheffield where they sorted me without cutting off my leg. The quality of treatment always depends on how good the doctor is. ALWAYS question and seek a second opinion.

8129,This is the worse hospital ever. The nurses here are rude with an attitude and not caring at all. I have made a formal complaint to QE PALS and the case is now being investigated by the CE. I urge all patients and their family who had faced terrible experience or care at this hospital to email your complaint to PALS so that your concerns are investigated and dealt with so other patients do not have to suffer like we did.
9705,"I'm now settled in at @RBNHSFT and ready for surgery (2nd on list). What I have found really positive is it's hubbys first time experiencing surgery with me and the medical team have included him in everything, making sure he's comfortable too. Thank you! "

Their admin is excellent and they really care about the patients. In addition in these difficult times they are so brave. "
4466,"CEO of North Bristol NHS Trust I can not explain the level of disgust at your dangerous continuous tenure within the NHS given you left so many victims (including myself) from both the North Middlesex Hospital and BEH MH Trust. The cronyism and sheer blatant nepotism that undoubtable enables your continued appointment is not acceptable - total abuse of public funds. I am going to embarrass you, hound you and humiliate you publicly out of the NHS. Watch & Read - naming your victims dead and alive. You are a safeguarding risk to patients and staff - clearly confirmed by the comments of Senior Ambulance Service Manager (Sept 2021)."

8789,Refusing to treat someone with a broken neck because they do not wish to take a covid test is called medical apartheid and tyranny. Shame on you! You have a duty of care. What happened to this country? 
8873,"My Father was admitted to Pinderfields Hospital last Tuesday. Mr. W. H. Sixsmith, he is deaf blind and I am extremely concerned about his welfare. I was given a telephone number 01924542433 of which I have been ringing for the past 7 days 3 times a day. Sometimes it rings and rings and rings - other times it is engaged for hours on end! He is extremely vulnerable with him being deaf and blind and communication limited. Reception say that he is still on the ward when 3 days ...after they informed me he was being discharged. ‚Ä¶ please, please for the sake of humanity and decent human compassion investigate the failings of my Father's well being and lack of communication."

597,"The care at The Royal Blackburn Hospital was outstanding. All the staff were very thorough, caring, attentive and relatable and after a diagnosis was made, the treatment was swift. The ward rooms were very clean, the TV easy to use and the meals were delicious I would definitely recommend this hospital."

They let my mum be with me, and were all so kind and understanding, they were friendly and helped my anxiety so much. I'd like to thank the day surgery unit, my anaesthetist and the facial and oral unit. You guys made it so much better for me and were so lovely, nothing was too much effort and I felt safe "
4824,Use the Hilton park road car park run by apoca it 5 min walk from the hospital but save on the wallet get a ticket though on entrance it camera monitored and they do patrol but it far cheaper and easier to get out of that the car park in the hospital.

9792,"Poor care - There was 2 nhs staff members that was outstanding and went above and beyond but unfortunately all other staff members I felt were unhelpful, didn't communicate throughout and I even witnessed a staff member more bothered about going for a fag than assisting colleagues with patients. I personally got moved to 3 different areas through my stay with one of them by being woken up by my items being placed at the end of my bed and actually being moved. Upon the notification of the 4th ward moved I discharged myself as they stated that the move was required due to covid though taking me to a 4th area in a short time is not considering covid it was putting me and other patients at a higher risk of getting covid. I witness nurses going against doctors request. I also witnessed nurses taking other nurses to move patients from a& e up to a ward regardless whether they had capacity and it was for the ward to deal with not them. I feel this is outrageous service and not enough care given to the actual patient. I was awaiting further investigation by way of a scan and no one could tell me when this would be just that I was on a list so therefore though still unwell felt that I would have better service through my GP. The communication is none existing. Like I said before there where 2 staff members that was a credit to your hospital but unfortunately lost amongst the poor staff. If there was more communication between departments and more urgency given then patients would not be left in the system taking up beds. I live in an area with no A& E and already have to travel far and Lincoln would appear to be the same as my previous experience some 15 years ago which was also terrible."
3470,"Hospital today, my mother fell hurt her head, we were treated brilliantly at Warrington Hospital, by all the staff. There is still a great service there, remember that. Keeping her in, as she has a fairly deep wound. @NetworkDementia The staff really are stars for sufferers."

5535,Physio - I have ms and it was suggested by my ms nurse that a course of physio could help me walk better. I was seen by 2 physios and from day 1 they identified my problem and gave me a number of exercises to do at home.Over the weeks further problems were identified and more exercises were added. Provided I keep doing the exercises I think my walking will improve. I have nothing but praise for the knowledge and ability to apply it that these two physio's have got and would have no hesitation in recommending them. .

8440,Had an appointment at the Burns Unit was very impressed with everything very well organized everywhere.
4861,"I actually started to feel worse - I went to A&E as I had sliced two of my fingers. On arrival at the Reception area, myself and a friend who had driven me, were informed in a rude manner to wait behind the sign. A few moments later the patient at the counter moved away. Due to the barrier, I don't think we heard the Receptionist call, as they were then unpleasant and made a sarcastic comment to a colleague when we arrived at the desk. I was called through to the nurse who I would not describe as at all compassionate. They informed me I had got myself worked up, that it wasn't that bad and clearly could not understand that not everyone can deal with looking at blood or an open wound. Due to my injury and this awful manner, I actually started to feel worse and became visibly upset. At this point, I think they may have realised that the 'bedside manner' was clearly lacking."
4881,"Don't know - Great service from the Rapid Response Nurse - Following a recent operation on my return home we encountered a few medical problems so a nurse from this hospital's Rapid Response Team was sent to help out. All problems were rectified in a pleasant, efficient and professional manner. A very big thank you to them and praise to a brilliant organisation."

3039,Mr kneble and his gang are wonderful just a shame I have to go to kidderminster for treatment when it was available in redditch. Such a bind as I can't drive afterwards which means I have to be taken and brought back. A truly unpleasant journey especially in rush hour or school time

6468,"Vascular surgery - Excellent treatment - From entering the hospital, having my abdominal aneurism stent surgery, and recovering on HDU and C32 ward, the service received was excellent. The staff were all professional, kind, patient and friendly. I cannot praise them enough, particularly at this difficult and stressful time. I also would like to mention that the food was of a very good standard! "
3273,The clinician on duty at 03:06 am on 23rd June 2021 is rude with several patients . Was showing attitude to the patients .My friend had hurt her foot and 111 advised her to go to the A&E. this lady on duty said ‚Äúignore 111's‚Äù advise . I am not sure if the lady at the reception is a doctor or a surgeon to advise patients Her attitude towards my friend and other patients is not acceptable
3954,"The Doctor that I had an appointment with following my initial assessment was outstanding and demonstrated the highest standard of medical advice, guidance and care. I am so grateful for the time he gave me and took me through the diagnosis and explained in full the causes and provided a range of considerations that would make an improvement of my condition and long term recovery. I should be grateful if you could contact him and pass on my personal thanks.I have recently attended the Respiratory Department and Dr Malik and his colleagues are exceptional in every thing they do. He personally carried out a medical procedure on me and he was amazing and a first class gentleman. Also Anna Hill and her in colleagues in Endoscopy are so caring and the colonoscopy that she carried out on me was outstanding. SDEC unit Dr Kevin Wang is another outstanding Doctor who has a great future. Denis A. Hird | All emergency staff unfortunately are having to operate in very challenging circumstances and considering all factors I do not think that there are any immediate improvements that could be made. It was good for me to spend the time waiting making some observational assessments on how the department was operating."

3561,"I am 77 and had fallen and have broken my hand/wrist. I was dealt with quickly then left for an hour atleast where everyone could see me and I think an X-ray had forgotten to be ordered. I understand all that, having worked in varying roles in the nhs for 28 years (which is why I would nt make a fuss) But I felt totally ignored as tho I was nt there which is what they say as you get old!! Where I was, was nt rushed with no other patients near me. Eventually one nurse did stop as she walked passed and she turned out to be extremely caring and helpful and I was able to thank her after. I am very grateful"
6647,Don't know - Excellent Help - The concierge really helped me to meet my appointment at a remote location in the grounds. In fact wheeled me to the location and back to the bus terminal. I am a stroke survivor with walking difficulties so really appreciated her help today.
4218,You couldnt have done any better than you did. everyone was very helpful and pleasant. everything went well. thankyou.
9019,I am very happy with the way I was treated thank you to the nurses they were really kind and helpful thank you to the doctor and overall It was a good experience I would think having a surgery wouldnt be good but they made me really comfortable and it went well . Thank you very much

6280,"General Surgery - First impression is Service isn't great - Recently attended Shotley Bridge Hospital Urgent Care Centre as my partner had a bad back. We were greeted with a very unpleasant person, who in my opinion tried to put us off with the wait time of ‚Äò2 hours' I asked if they knew what the approx wait time in Durham hospital was they advised quite abruptly ‚Äò6 hours' the person who filled in my partners details were extremely rude and didn't feel approachable at all. People come to hospital when they need to, as they are unwell - so the last thing you want to be met with is a rude character. I think this needs looked at as the reception is the first impression of this urgent care centre. This review isn't a reflection on the service when seeing doctors / nieces etc. "
2393,Very good service. Maria was very good and made me feel comfortable. Very impressed
2073,"Need to say a big thank you to @NWAmb_Wellbeing, within an hour of self Isolating recieved a call asking if i and my family were ok, did we need any shopping, anything else they could do to help. Really does make a difference to feel cared for and valued @NWAmbulance"
4979,Yesterday had a cardiac abrilation at Castle Hill hospital on THE NHS. The nursing staff and Dr Cardwell were amazing. Couldn't have had better treatment if I'd gone https://t.co / VxPADa75Xs the fish pie was superb Well done üëèüëèüëèüëçüò∑
5447,Awful place to be in.... They make you to wait all day no help no nothing at all workers just laughing staring at you they will make you to die as well... Not good place at all They put u in some kind of room yh make you to stay inside for some hours like is this normal that unbelievable
6820,"Absolutely useless hospital. The clinicians and staff are unhelpful to say the very least, particularly the A&E reception staff."
3105,".@OxleasNHS Thanks to the Urgent Care Centre at Queen Mary's Hospital. They did very well treating my 89 year old Mother today, who broke her left arm and was very discombobulated. Let's hope whatever government is next in office, they increase resources."
3021,"Breast cancer services - Great experience, lovely staff - Just wanted to say a big thank you to all the staff I saw on the 24th September. After discovering an underarm lump I'd got all worked up and had a referral to the clinic. Every member of staff was so friendly, caring and compassionate through what is a rather unpleasant experience! They really put me at ease and I felt that I had been thoroughly checked out and all the necessary tests undertaken to reach their conclusion. I received good news with nothing to worry about, so that probably helped my experience a lot! But I just wanted to say thank you to the staff - they are an absolute credit to the hospital and the NHS, who must be under so much pressure right now. Anyone who has a worry about their breasts or underarms, please get a referral to this team as I have no doubt you will be very well looked after, whether the outcome is positive or not so much. "
3748,.I received excellent service.
6639,
2830,Could be worse...
6418,Good luck to anyone who is unfortunate enough to have to use this hospital . My partner who had a serious infection was provably termed away by an A&E doctor and given a lecture for wasting his time . When we returned in the afternoon she was told she had to be admitted she waited 7 hours to go to a ward because someone had forgot to phone through confirmation of her bloods and COVID test 7 days on we are still waiting for her to have a scan on her foot . Everyday we are told it's tomorrow then it doesn't happen. And no body will give any straight answers . If you have the opportunity please go to another hospital.
9016,Any news for the public of when the outpatients are going to resume taking patients face to face?? ..because I'm having trouble getting someone to examine my eyes..after many phone calls of which I have been hung up on..lost referrals since February...telephone consultations which have been totally forgotten about...while I sit waiting...shocking service..time to get back to normal service now..this cannot go on..People need this service.
7984,"After waiting for 3 hours with a sick baby at A&E, I was told If I am not calling you by 5 a.m., please remind me. 5 a.m being another 4 hours wait. I appreciate A&E being busy, but at least for babies should be a different attendance. Disappointed in some staff's attitude as well. No one goes to A&E because they have nothing else to do."
1211,"I went to the A&E department and waited to be seen due to my asthma. I was struggling to breath and I asked the nurse in the clinic today I think she was Spanish, if I could be seen urgently as lots of people that attended after me were seen first. Her response was ‚Äúyou can talk it can't be that bad‚Äù she was rude and dismissive and exacerbated my condition. I went back to the waiting area struggling to breath. This was on the 26/01/2020 at around 12:00hrs. She was in treatment room 1. Really disgusting Treatment."
1083,"Nothing, service was exemplary in spite of the risks all the staff are facing at the moment and all delivered with a smile. Thankyou"
3843,Thank You so very much to @gelatodiariela for the amazing treat of ice cream for our @WhitHealth Bed Based Care Staff it was delicious & your kindness helped keep us to keep going. #NHSheroes üåàüíôüôè https://t.co / LYCizlVthk
8698,Happy with the good service I received in out patients.
6032,"If I could say 10 star service I would. Every single nurse, doctor, Porter anyone I came into contact with in this hospital went above and beyond! Can't fault the service I've had here. Thank you so much for making me feel better! "
9898,"Excellent experience there with a lovely staff and a great organisation. They told me how long I would have before to be seen and they were perfectly on time. It was efficient and the doctor was great. The building is new and welcoming, easy to access. Compared to other countries I know it was definitely the best and most satisfying experience in a medical organisation."
8719,"Thank you for my visit today üëç . As we are approaching 2 years since our lives changed dramatically on 15.02.2018. . We thought it would be nice and well deserved to recognise the team at Kent, Surrey and Sussex air ambulance today who saved our Nathan's life when he had a serious brain injury accident. ... Without them attending and giving the best care then taking him to St. George's hospital in London quickly he would not be here with us today. We have raised money from Nathan's surprise 30th birthday party and a charity event recently held.. We raised an incredible amount of 1070 and hsbc bank are kindly donating a further 1000. . Grand total of 2070.. We had the honour of meeting some of the incredible team today who attended on the day to give our special thanks personally.. Sarita and Sam and the rest of the team - Thank you."
871,"Fantastic Hospital. Parking is free, good to have someone in side the front door to guide you where to go. Very clean looking. The sisters and nurses couldn't do enough for you, especially Sam. Great knowledge and service. Will always try to get here for any surgery. 10/10 x"
5755,"Dr Valavanis was excellent yesterday in his care, attention and support. He listened closely, gave sage advice and left me feeling reassured, happy and confident. He could not have done any more for me."
8751,DO NOT GO TO A&E AT THIS HOSPITAL. Drive the extra mile to King George. Total incompetence. No sense of urgency. Wife crying in pain. Asking irrelevant questions.Walked out after 3 hours. Total shambles
6600,"I had to call for an ambulance for a lady who was very unwell. I was asked to only call back if she got worse. She did, I called back. The women who answered were calm helpful and very reassuring. Thank you All"
2001,"Endocrinology and Metabolic Medicine - Thank you - Would just like to say thank you to the Dr & staff in the Endocrinology Clinic today. You have all been professional, kind & supportive, which was very much appreciated. Also thank you to the lady from PALS (you know who you are üòâ), who kindly attended my appointment with me. Your support ment more than you know."
4696,"Great support - I received help and support via the Silvercloud platform to deal with my anxiety. The modules were very helpful, I was provided with techniques to help myself deal with my anxiety. I was very happy with the feedback and support from my supporter. She was very kind and helpful and made the whole process feel natural and safe."
9987,"I was impressed by the overall efficiency. Staff were actually kind and polite. If they were jaded, it didnt show. The Streaming Nurse has been needed for a long time. They are such a good addition to anxious patients often sitting for quite a while i.e. awaiting test results and who need a point of contact. I think when in pain and frightened, the worse thing is to come to hospital where theres total disimpowerment. People worry that no one is concerned..that theyve been abandoned. The staff know there are delays and why but the patients dont necessarily understand so someone on the scene and at hand i"
6507,"Parking is free at the moment but less spaces due to several mobile clinics and constructions around taking up parking spaces. I hope they will have a long term solution to their parking as the population increases the need also will arise. For the benefit of the patients as well as staffs, they should build a building for that purpose."
3818,Constant false promises never again
5475,Excellent
5413,Because the treatment i got given was excellent and every one was so kind and helpful and if I needed any pain relief I didnt have to wait long thank you
1817,"A massive thank you to ALL of the staff who were involved in COVID-19 antibody testing today at MCHFT, you all worked so efficiently & demonstrated such care & compassion & made me feel safe & calm. You are all awesome üåàüòÄ@MidCheshireNHS @MCHFTPostGrad #COVID19 #antibodytest"
3902,Helpful qualified staff offering support where needed
8362,Staff were helpful and the area was very well organised. Disappointed with some staff as I was walking into the hospital and patients not following the basic one way arrows by the shops
2817,I had to wait an hour and a half before I was seen. The doctors and nurses were fabulous though.
6499,Terrible blood taking. Retrain staff and perhaps teach them that xenophobia is not going to get them anywhere. Bruised arm and sore long after the appointment.
6109,Painstakingly detailed review in the eye clinic - very positive action plan agreed - very satisfied/happy patient
919,A MASSIVE thank you to the people at @leonrestaurants for providing amazing food to NHS staff at Hammersmith hospital. We really appreciate it. #LeonRestaurant #HealthyFood #Lunch #Dinner
2470,"Abysmal experience - Extremely haughty, arrogant staff who are far, far worse doctors than they think they are. Briefly, they got my diagnosis completely wrong. I was rushed for the whole of my time there, while they cancelled and rescheduled my appointment many times, and I would not care if they gave good medical treatment. But I was barely examined and offered a Botox injection for scarring (in a delicate place that can't function properly with a wrongly healing scar) that had healed wrongly without even looking and actually talked over me and ignored when I said repeatedly I'd like to hear more options and why he thinks this is a good treatment. He then told me he had no more questions and asked me to leave as he was busy to see the next patient. I called the hospital reception after to ask for another consultation and was told, rudely I will add, that the next one they could fit in would be in a years time‚Ä¶ Needless to say I am never going back to this hospital and the only person I would recommend it to is my worst enemy."
6394,"Thank you NHS and all at Poole Hospital, everyone was so cheerful, helpful and supportive after admission on 29th September with fractured femur. From A&E Dr Dominic, C3 ward and Millie and B3 Ward Daniel, Big John and everyone. Denis Oldis"
6470,"Gastrointestinal and Liver services - Great Care - I was transferred to Queens from another hospital to treat me for gallbladder infection and stones. I stayed for 6 days. The nurses and carers in my ward were absolutely brilliant. They were kind, respectful, helpful and patient. I felt really taken care of, especially when I was in tremendous pain after my procedure. I really cannot give my thanks and appreciation properly, I am so grateful for them. The doctors and consultants of course were very kind, helpful and knowledgeable too. There are many posters around the hospital saying to respect the NHS staff, but other than that I do not think much is being done about the abuse staff (may) face. In my ward there was a patient who was extremely and unnecessary rude to a nurse, who was one of the kindest I've ever met. I felt really bad for the nurse, they were doing their absolute best, and felt sorry that they were treated so rudely by the patient when they were just trying to help. Overall, the staff especially the nurses and carers are the best, top notch, always giving 110 percent, but wish they were treated with more respect, and wish more measures would've been taken to make sure other patients do not take advantage, and mistreat the staff. "
3553,Car park was nearly full yet hospital seemed quiet. Was it because parking was free? 
6828,"Another trip to @SalisburyNHS #fractureclinic this morning. Fabulous service - son's plaster off, pins out of arm, X-ray, chat with consultant, splinted and back out the door within 30mins of arriving! Thanks #NHS"
5211,"Diagnostic Endoscopy - Excellent care - I attended the endoscopy department today. All staff were lovely, kind and caring. I did not feel rushed. They provided clear explanation at every stage and I felt reassured. I felt care about and for. I had been very anxious about the procedure but this dissipated on the unit. Staff adhered to Covid safe practice and the unit was clean. I am hugely impressed with the care and service I received today and would like to thank the team. "
3519,"Nice little hospital in a rural setting. My mum spent almost 2 weeks there. The wards are small-4 bed mostly, and most patient seemed to be quite elderly. Food was good, unlike some hospitals, and although staff were busy, they seemed quite attentive most of the time. Mum would opt to go back again if a hospital stay was deemed necessary."
3824,"Lovely care and staff - I had a cystoscopy by Lancaster House today and all staff, especially the doctor were extremely polite, kind and helpful. I felt assured and left with all information I needed. Amazing NHS service "
2903,"It was freezing - I visited A and E today, it was freezing in the Minors waiting area. It was unpleasant for everyone especially those who are unwell. "
3964,If Epsom doesn't kill you these guys will
5127,Knowing full well how bad my breathing condition was an my past history. I was moved to a Covid ward without Covid in June of this year. I was set up to have a CT scan done. Something I have begged the NHS for over a year now to have. To help determine the lung damage and hopefully push towards a diagnosis for COPD or another form of lung disease. However for no explained reason my CT was cancelled and I was pushed out the door. Practically begging them to just continue what they had already set up to do. Absolutely vile and disgusting. I have been begging the NHS for help for over a year now and I've been left with worsening breathing and feat for my lungs. They take COVID as an extended holiday as the wardwas practically empty in my time there. Nurses vile and rude. Doctors uncaring and rude. And we pay our tax and trust our lives to these people? Now October and being told still not accepting nw respiratory patients. So does the rest of the world without Covid just do one? Can I stop paying my NI if I'm not getting any forn of treatment from the NHS? Absolute shambles. At this rate is rather Boris tear the trash down than let it continue to let others suffer.
4409,"Want to say a big thank you to friends of the department @CycleRepublicUK #birmingham for fixing Darren's bike today (free of charge). @BWC_NHS staff, they are happy to help with all your cycling needs üö≤ We really appreciate your kindness @CycleRepublicUK ü§© @BCRbirmingham"
8797,Accident and emergency services - Superb practice - I went today with my partner to emergency practice. He have some chest pain. All staff was quick and very helpfull. They check my husband carefull and repeat the blood test twice to make sure everything is ok. Thank you so much for doctor and his team for great and unvaluable help. 
9863,prompt service. clear advice.professional
1025,"Department was very clean and not crowded.I didnt have to wait very long to be seen.Staff I met were very approachable, kind and friendly"
5943,So far the service and care and kindness has been second to none.
1289,I thought losing my Dad at 18 was the hardest thing I'd have to deal with in life! Wrong! Having 2 kids under the care of @GreatOrmondSt 1 for Gastro & 1 for a Brain tumour is. Im lucky to have support. If things are too much for you remember to reach out. Help is out there.
9151,"Good care on stroke unit - I was sent to Berman 1 ward at Nottingham City Hospital after a fall and a day in the A & E department. I was to be investigated for a possible TIA. I arrived in the middle of the night but I was quickly made comfortable and assessed thoroughly. The care on the ward was really good. The general atmosphere was efficient but friendly, which gave me confidence that I would be treated well and thoroughly. The staff were all excellent, including doctors, nurses, HCAs, cleaners, therapists and everyone else too. All the necessary investigations were done and I wasn't sent home until the physiotherapist was assured that I could walk and manage the stairs, and the occupational therapist had tested me making a drink. This gave me confidence that I was safe to be discharged. The food was delicious and plentiful in the time I was there, and the staff found the time to interact with the patients. I would particularly mention the HCA. Nothing was too much trouble for her, from helping me to the bathroom to getting answers to my questions and she walked miles escorting me to and from my scans. There are so many problems with the NHS at the moment, but I can have no complaints about my stay on Berman 1 ward."
7904,Husband in #UCLH today and it was empty. He is OK thank goodness.
7536,As a former patient I cannot speak highly enough of this facility. 3 years ago I chose Rosemere as my dedicated charity when I was Lady Captain at Pleasington and it was so well supported as so many people think so highly of it. I am currently taking my Dad for radiotherapy and he has so much confidence due to my experience and the way he was been treated. 5 stars just isn't enough üíô
8876,I had operations on both my eyes and could not have had better treatment from the staff in the ophthalmology department. I would most definitely recommend the Lister to anyone requiring procedures on their eyes and I would certainly return there if I have any issues in the future. Thank you to everyone in the department.
6100,"I was an inpatient at UCLH Westmoreland Street over night and would just like to thank everyone involved in my care for this visit in this very trying year of 2020, I was so well looked after and felt everyone found time to explain things and also listen to me. Staff seemed warm and caring. Keep up the good work."

653,After suffering a whole week of abdominal pain and my GP being fully booked.. I attended RLH to the clinic 1 emergency room (Stepney Way) The GP DR MIAH made me feel very uncomfortable as soon as I entered the room he said I gave him a bad energy! I have never met this guy in my life and I'm going through extreme pain but my pain wasn't concerning to him! After telling him my pain was like labour cramps he said ‚ÄúIf the pain is that bad why am I coming after a week‚Äù instead of showing care for concern he was patronising and intimidating and rude! I gave him a valid response and he was huffing and puffing. I asked him if he can refer me for a scan as I feel there is something internally wrong with me and he said his not going to do that as he thinks there's nothing wrong with me. I said but how would You know if you haven't checked as only I know what I'm going through! I asked him what his name was and he straight away got angry and said I'm threatening him I asked him to call his manager and I asked to see her badge just as proof that this is the manager of the department. Soon as she walked in DR MIAH made so much lies to his manager saying I was swearing and pointing omg and then the manager says she believes him cause I intimidated her by asking to see her badge! If I'm sick and feel threatened and unsafe by a member of the nhs staff who's duty is to care for the sick.. then I have a right to take their name.. They are not use to someone speaking Up! Guys please this guy is very unprofessional and rude and he needs to be sacked asap!!! If anything happens to me it will be DR MIAHS fault! 
6616,So I've been in hospital daily visting my grandma and my grandma has like 5 family members with her every day for the whole day and seeing around the ward there is 4 elderly white ladies with not a single person visiting and it's sad to see them so unwell but not a single family
8368,Huge thank you to @Bham_Childrens for the amazing care my daughter received over the last 5 days in hospital. For keeping us safe as possible and providing the best care even during a pandemic ‚ù§Ô∏è
3362,Very clean and really nice staff
8665,"Friendly helpful staff, nothing too much trouble"
5248,The doctor I saw was very lovely. She was so supportive and I came away a lot happier and ready for my Chemotherapy today. Thank you. One thing I would say is I did have a couple of staff talking outside where I was about life insurance. As someone with inoperable cancer and a young child I did find this upsetting. The lady who was taking my blood at the time thought that she was upsetting me and she wasnt. I know it is a place of work and that people should have normal conversations but it would be helpful if they thought about the illness the person has as on a different day I would have become very dis

3480,Urology - Left on pain - I yave been under uclh since 2001 I need a day surgery every year as I have narrowing of the uretha and need this operation or I am in serious danger of retention I cant get no response as to when I shall have my operation. Yes we are all fully aware of the covid19 situation but does that warrant thousands suffering left in agony it is inhumane 
1261,24 Hours In A&E - @StGeorgesTrust is an incredible place. Saved my life.
4265,"I wanted to give a quick shout out to @CNWLNHS mental health services, within a week of calling I've got my first appointment booked. Please reach out if you need support, this is not easy for any of us but there are services here to help you, so call your GP! üíô"

7575,Well looked after nice staff | Nothing
3109,There are only 3 words to describe this hospital and that is to AVOID AVOID AVOID! it's the worst hospital I've ever had the unfortunate pleasure to be treated in! For some unknown reason everytime I have the unfortunate pleasure to visit this hospital for treatment they have got me down as deceased! Only for me to tell them that as they can see I'm very much alive! I've even been told that I have had a colonoscopy procedure done at a hospital in Milton Keynes instead of university hospital Coventry! I could write a book with the unfortunate experiences I've unfortunately have had to endure at this hospita! l as I said earlier if you are looking to be cared for and treated with dignity compassion and above all respect I would advise you very strongly to look for and attend another hospital elsewhere as you will certainly not get it here! The staff are rude incompassionate and have no empathy or respect whatsoever! And everytime you try to phone reception they never answer the phone you've got more chance of getting through to the man in the moon! As I said earlier in my review AVOID AVOID AVOID! 
2486,"Horrific service at the UTC. After dropping my card at the UTC, I waited for 3 hours before going to the reception desk to ask me how many people are ahead he told me 3. I went back another 1 hour 20 later to ask him how long I got more and this Asian guy at the desk with a stubble, started giving me attitude like you've asked me twice already, we're just the reception while raising his voice. It was very irritating and I kept my cool and went back to my seat. I was seen Almost 5 hours later for a BREATHING problem. A very serious condition where I was given a green card to wait for 5 hours."

1427,"Breast cancer services - Unbelievable level of care - I was referred by my GP under the two week pathway to the one stop breast unit at Burnley Hospital. I attended today and felt that I must offer my sincere thanks to everyone I encountered for their professionalism and care for me as a person. At every stage, the COVID precautions were appropriate, so I had no concerns about the safety. It was reassuring to be addressed by name by every member of staff and I could not fault the time spent by the consultant both in examining me and then explaining what she had found and what the next steps would be. I also was interviewed and examined by a medical student and was impressed that the consultant explained things to her as well. I was referred for a mammogram and ultrasound and was grateful that these could be carried out within a few minutes on the same site and that the advanced practitioner was able to give me the results immediately. In conclusion, thank you to everyone in the department for a most impressive service."
4074,Today I was seen for a follow up appointment in ENT outpatients following an illness that I was admitted to UHCW via A And E back in August - The whole of Mr Prashads team have been so thorough and reassuring throughout - carrying out every investigation they could and referring to other departments as necessary - they have been amazing and can't thank them all enough - they have all worked above and beyond and should be very proud of the care they have provided

4545,Very good medical and nursing care at all times.
7997,Don't know - what nice people - I was in swift ward last month. never seen anything like it. there was a tennis party and the staff dressed up and sang to patients. strawberry and cream and shandy were given to us. really cheered me up and old folk were joining in even the ones who do not know where they are with dimentia. the nurses are always nice and coming up with ideas to keep busy like games and talks about normal stuff. I actually enjoyed being there.

877,"Good signposting to the department, clear instructions where to walk and one way systems in the department. Easy to distance from everyone, I didnt have to wait long past my appointment time, and everything was clearly explained to me. A nice clean well organised hospital. I felt totally safe there and my appointment was good. Thank you"
3502,"Really helpful and knowledgeable - I've been trying to research stairlifts, and went along to get some advice. The OT took the time to get to know me and my circumstances. She was extremely helpful and offered some really helpful insight. I felt listened to, never felt rushed, and I left with a much clearer idea of what I need It's a brilliant resource, which I will definitely use again."
5480,So I found my A&E experience not so bad yesterday at Northwick Park and they were so busy at one point it was standing room only. Found the whole process v efficient and was treated with much care. @LNWH_NHS Staff were stretched past breaking point but resilient and amazing.
3395,Excellent care received from start to finish
828,I always am impressed on the organisation and minimal waiting times. If I even lookLike I might be lost always someone comes to help. My only gripe is that I find navigating is difficult and I always get lost. But help is always there.
8525,"Where to start... Arrived with a very high heartrate suspicion of heartattack.(having lasting symptoms for the past few days) Reception staff were fast and amazing, very supportive. I can't say the same about the Nurse / HCA who took my initial observations. He was talking down on me, I felt really humiliated and felt I am wasting his precious time. Comments about the way I am feeling without even being seen by a doctor yet with final diagnosis was disgraceful . Had then my ecg done by another nurse who was very kind and lovely, help me to calm down, im so grateful. Finally after some wait, i had an appointment with Dr who was very professional and nice, so luckily after all the tests, I've been diagnosed with anxiety attack. (But you'll never know when this happens) Dr said I've done the right thing to come to the hospital for a check and he will send suggestion to my gp for me being monitored for 24h, not like the Nurse who's time I was wasting saying just breath and calm down (having heartrate 167bpm dropping to 135bpm, tight chest, light-headed and who was treating me like I was just another attention seeker) I had a good advice from the Dr and future actions will be done by his suggestions. I am still shocked. Big thank you Dr and the Reception staff! üôè"
9103,What was good?Staff lovely and extremely supportive. Thank you all.What could we do better?
480,Dr de VOS superb
8603,"Fantastic GP Practice - I have been registered to Wolverton Health Centre and I can say that I have never had a negative experience. From the reception team who are always friendly and helpful, the nurses who very knowledgeable and good at what they do, to the GP practitioners who are excellent in their patient care and who I have always found to be very supportive. I can always get an appointment when I want and the care is amazing. It is so easy for people to make a fuss in situations where something is wrong, so I just wanted to take the time to shout about the positives and how amazing they perform. Thank you."
9701,They dealt with my problem really well the only criticism I have amount of time I had to wait to see someone but I dont suppose much can be done if you have a lot of patience.
1528,I can not thank the amazing lovely staff enough today at Grimsby A&E department! All of them were under an enormous amount of pressure and were extremely busy! however the smiles and kindness they showed my son was in abundance. He was brought in by ambulance by 2 wonderful paramedics (Tom? and Dom) they were from the Scunthorpe crew they went above and behond making my son feel comfortable and pain free. They both deserve credit for being so amazing! Once arriving at hospital all the staff who dealt with my son were friendly and kind and never kept us waiting long at all. So thank you all for the amazing wonderful work you all do. Ignore all the bad press and keep doing what you are doing x

5335,Good hospital and amazing doctors and nurses when had an operation was in the best care possible
4499,Definitely wouldn't recommend the maternity unit!! Tried to force me to abort my son at 20 plus weeks and told me he would die anyway!! Continued to force me to sign for surgery to remove my pregnancy!! I denied and denied!! This still haunts me! 5 years later he's alive well and thriving! ...
2368,Had 3 visits by ambulance for chest pains..ambulance crew amazing service. Hospital staff very helpful and efficient. Explained problems and way to move on.overnight stay.ct scan..etc.many enlightening chats with medical staff at all levels. Great service.
8655,I had my daughter at 33 weeks in NICU and the staff was more than amazing. The most fantastic team ever. This month my mum was in PALM WARD with pneumonia and I just want to say a big loud thank you to everyone there.

Yet again it makes me so happy to see such amazing staff so caring and trying to do their best. THANK YOU!

2168,"Horrible system they have in place, trying to be more like Stafford hospital, but it just fails. Takes forever to find a place to park at times, the 'one way' system seemingly only affects the disabled spaces for some reason. Usually better to park in the multistorey if you can walk across."
6474,On time and friendly staff
5669,If I could post -10000 I would I really do recommend government close this hospital down the treatment I had in the maternity unit was beyond humain ....they wrote false information in my notes due to me saying I'm going to write a complaint but now due to circumstances of false information and neglect of my health as well as mental health I'm now going forward with photo evidence to a court please don't go here if your pregnant have mental health or diabetes awful awful lying staff they will lie to keep there job but with cctv and photo evidence they won't get away with what mistakes they have done could cost someone's life
3379,Great staff - I was taken to hospital with severe covid and put instantly in to icu! The staff are amazing I felt at ease watching them work and how calm they were made me calm in a position and situation where calm to me didn't feel possible! They catered to my every need and looked after me as If I was there own I truly owe them my life and was humbled by these people never once did I hear them Moan or complain professional through and through! And when it came to being put on d3 my recovery was quick and almost enjoyable the staff were quick to pick us up laughter as well as all the care they made it feel like the only way was up I will be forever extremely to Both sets of nurses and docs from both units I was on because they was amazing 
185,Waiting time of just under an hour.
2663,"Fern Centre Wig Service - The wig I choose is so perfect I love it, thank you. I found the experience relaxing and I felt reassured that the wig looked natural which was important to me.

1214,"I came in with serious abdominal pain. There was no urgency to help me. I was given one dose of morphine and put in a waiting area with a load of other patients. After three hours the morphine lost its effect and I was in agony again. I requested something for the pain. It took almost an hour with my mother asking 4 times for me to finally get pain relief. Then I was taken to have a scan. There was no definitive result. So I was moved to another ward, there were no beds at the time. So I was asked to temporarily lay on a hard examination bed. I was on it for 5 hours with no blanket. To which I still had no idea what was wrong with me. They told me a member of the surgical team was going to come and speak to me. Another 3 hours of waiting on a hard examination bed with no blanket. There was no drive from the staff to help me or others. They did their rounds and then idly chatted away about what they had planned for the weekend."
2102,Back at #basildonhospital with my little boy minor injuries sent me here to get him checked properly as need to make sure the spider has not put venom in him as it was a false widow spider üï∑Ô∏è and not just a gnat they said üò¢
4739,"Everything worked like a dream, I was seen quickly. In and out within 45 mins. I was seen and put at ease by a great member of staff who checked me over thoroughly!"
8093,Day treatment services - Excellent nursing - Cannot fault the day surgery unit at the Treatment Centre. Everything ran very smoothly and all the staff without exception were kind and helpful. The nurse who was allotted to me upon arrival is outstanding in her care of patients - she goes that extra mile and is exceptionally kind as well as professional! 
2118,"Had to get some regular #NHS checkups at #UCLH today. What an incredible service. Swift, efficient and friendly. These guys deserve all our support. I do not trust the Tories to protect them - or us. #NHSNotforSale"

4326,"As usual the nurses on the day ward were professional, friendly and efficient making me feel comfortable and safe during my treatment."
5022,
6948,I've been to this hospital a few times. A couple of years ago I had a bad experience with them since I was feeling suicidal but since I was underage I had to be taken to Bristol hospital instead. The last time I came here was in April and they were helpful and they had a nurse watch over me since I was having a very bad panic attack. They did some tests and then arranged the crisis team for me when I got home also helped me arrange a taxi to get home
5234,The hospital is old and tired and need of major investment. The staff are excellent but they are stretched and under staffed. After a recent issue I went to St George's Hospital instead.
627,"All of the nursing staff are amazing at jph. They all go out of their way to help in anyway they can. I recently visited the ambulatory unit due to a pseudomonas infection. The nurses couldn't have been any kinder, and massive thankyou to the nurse for holding my hand while had my spc changed. Not being able to have my mum with me was hard but made easier by the nurses.. Think some of the doctors could learn from the nurses."

9760,Ophthalmology - Consultant and his team - I have been under the consultant's care for a year. I have always found him to be professional and respectful. He explained everything fully and presented the options and did not rush consultations. The consultant undertook surgery to improve my vision and restore the appearance of my eye using techniques that I had not thought possible many years after childhood surgery. The results are beyond my expectations and I am very grateful to him and his team.
4761,I was seen and treated efficiently within the expected time.
2007,"Lack of communication on what was happening, no indication of wait times, dealt with same male nurse I have seen on several other occasions when visiting the pead A&amp;E who I think is rude and not well suited to his role every time I have dealings with him.  | Indicated wait times, last time board was updated was 07/09 our visit was 10/09."
1527,"Great service, well done to you all - Came for my covid jab today, what a great service and so efficient, well done to you all, you are doing a smashing job stay safe all of you and let's hope this is all over soon Kind regards Mrs cardwell"

9044,I haven't been for awhile but the treatment I received worked very well. I was treated by all staff with respect politeness and kindness. Highly recommended this place
1532,was told by an A+E doctor that a CT scan had showed a mass on my brain he thought was a previous breast cancer spread. NO follow up from DRI and Jasmine Centre absolutely useless!! It had also been coded on my online patient record that I had brain metastases without any sort of communication or confirmation from DRI. I had to wait 10 agonising days before being told by Sheffield that the tumor was benign!! Absolutely appaling care and service and will be taking it further
607,Ok have been to a lot worse.
9990,"This is a great hospital, there has been times in A&E where I have been waiting for what seems days, it has never been under 5 hours, but nonetheless this is a very good hospital and probably one of the best in London."

6593,"A massive thank you to @SheffieldHosp for my treatment today. I attended for an X-ray with a CT scan scheduled for Friday morning. X-ray done, I was offered the CT straight away so I didn't have to attend twice in the week Brilliant! These medics can see right through you ü¶¥"
1035,"Have had nothing but positive experiences here, from my son burning his legs to the knees, to end of life care for my brother. I found the staff caring, happy to discuss situations and options and Intensive Care in particular were supportive and kind."

3433,"Unhappy experience - I am a Registered Nurse so I respect the amount of workload nurses have at the moment. I will like to say the health adviser was very supportive, empathetic and welcoming. The procedures were satisfactory but the communication by the Nurse was lacking in the professionalism. Even allowing for resources are now stretched, I did feel that the time spent was a little rushed as well. Therefore my experience was not pleasant"

9937,Very helpful | nothing
2778,"All quite efficient, calm and stress-free, seen promptly."
2715,I'm waiting very long.
4846,Ophthalmology - Good service - I called Eye Casualty on the advice of my optician. The phone was answered promptly by helpful member of the team who asked me series of questions to understand the nature of my problem and explained that this could be dealt with by the Community service . They then found a optician local to me offering this service and made the referral. This all worked very efficiently and I received an entirely appropriate service a few hours later presumably keeping the hospital department appointments available for more serious cases. Thank you 
499,Clinical Treatment
5038,The worst service ever. People comming in after you go before you. What a load of rubbish.
8546,"Staff are incredibly welcoming and helpful. If you're up for a 5 hour wait, this place is incredibly pleasant and clean. Bring a picnic and something to pass the time. Also don't expect to be treated after your wait, enjoy the air conditioning in the summer and the heating in the winter. Make the most of the water dispensers and free masks but don't come here if you need medical treatment."
5486,"Surgeons, doctors, nurses, physio and domestic staff are all brilliant and I can't thank everybody enough for their skill and care. The reason for missing the very good check box is because of the appalling communications between doctors and the rest of the staff and between doctors and the patients."
6307,"Very efficient friendly  | Probably speed the process of seeing patients it didn't seem consistent, big gaps of patients not been seen."
2341,
3387,Attended main outpatients today was impressed with fabulous and friendly staff. From entering the hospital I was given clear instructions and good facilities to keep to COVID restrictions . Well done üëè
121,Very busy hospital in town.
6599,The car park is hopeless and expensive; there are not enough spaces for the number of attendees at the hospital. The fees are excessive for a car park and it seems unfair to punish those who are ill by charging exorbitant fees for their visit.
1923,"Don't know - Amazing staff - I had to go to A & E yesterday for acute tonsillitis. The 3 ladies in reception were kind & lovely. Gave me a glass of water & did my checks then sent me off to the ACC department, security were also really kind in showing me where to go bearing in mind that I could hardly talk & was on my own. ACC were organised & I wanted to say an extra special thank you to the junior nurse Ria who looked after me. She was kind & lovely & I was in & out within 6 hours. My ear nose & throat specialist was also very efficient. Well done NGH in this hard time. Kind Regards Kerry Kilner "
5743,Staff Attitude

4953,"Efficient and kind nurses - I have been having regular blood tests to explore why I am not yet pregnant. Every time I've gone to the Beacon at 730am or 8am (when they first open) and have been seen within a half hour - 45 minutes. The atmosphere is as nice as it could be - nurses have the radio on and can be heard chatting to people through out, all of which helped with my nervousness around blood tests and feeling sad as to why I was there. I ended up telling one of the nurses why I was there and she was so kind I had a relieved cry afterwards. Thank you. "
3863,"Helpful and friendly staff, each step of the process explained, consultation very satisfactory."
3999,Big thanks to all who observe the lockdown rules. My son had to go to hospital today for a checkup (nasty bout of gastro enteritis) and was seen quickly because the hospital was not overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases. GWS Big shout out to @RoyalSurrey for excellent care as always x

5357,"Orthopaedics - Excellent care - Although a very busy, and overstretched, department, I was seen and kept informed of delay to seeing consultant. He was excellent, and listened carefully.

6738,"Don't know - NHS at it's best - My elderly father who was involuntarily thrashing, shaking wildly and uncontrollably and unable to speak, was taken by ambulance by 2 wonderful paramedics who were fully up to speed from point of arrival and made excellent decisions to ensure the best care and outcomes for my dad. Once in A&E, the doctors and nurses were fully up to speed and gave dad excellent and immediate care ensuring a variety of tests were carried out asap and results were delivered quickly. The doctor was fantastic. He left no stone unturned to get a diagnosis and / or clearer picture of what could be happening to my dad which was difficult because my dad already has Parkinson's Disease. The network and liaisons that A&E made with other departments was faultless and staff arrived in A&E from other departments to continue with investigations regarding my father (including visits from stroke team and Parkinson's team who again made carefully considered decisions for the best outcome for my dad). Despite being a busy day on A&E there was a hard-working, calm, professional and friendly atmosphere in the department at all time. Without exception all the staff were extremely kind and very attentive (doctor, nurses, porters). At no point was my dad forgotten, put aside or left with questions unanswered. When my dad's extreme presentation subsided he went to Ilchester ward where staff were again excellent including keeping my dad's complex timed medication schedule on track. Nothing seemed too much trouble for the staff on the ward not just for dad but for all the patients. Dad then moved to Evershot ward where again the excellent care continued. Thank you to the parkinsons consultant for his excellent, thorough and still ongoing investigations to provide best outcomes for my dad and for being so kind, considered and unhurried when conversing with him. His knowledge of Dad's medical history and current condition is faultless. Dad's now happily back home with mum. This was a fine example of the NHS at its very best."

8423,"Great service - It seems that hardly a day goes by without a report on the NHS failure to achieve their targets in respect of waiting times. Whilst the public, quite rightly, rallied to show their support for health workers during the worse days of the pandemic, we are now back to criticising nearly every aspect of their operation. I therefore feel compelled to put on record, my own experiences with the NHS, from my initial consultation with my GP to my most recent investigative tests culminating in a diagnosis of prostate cancer. In all, I have had eight tests or referrals in two months. This time span would have been even shorter but for the fact that many of these tests were delayed by me as I had three separate, week long holidays during this period. At all stages the staff were friendly, professional and kept me informed of everything I needed to know. My diagnosis is not what I wanted to hear, but I have every confidence that I'm being looked after by the best possible team. Well done NHS. Derek Delaney - [ ] "
946,"I went in following a fall in which I injured my hand. The doctor did not seem to be sympathetic about my injury, as he did not feel Id fractured anything. This might be the case, but he did not offer any suggestions of what to do for a sprain injury, and in the days following the pain has not eased and I have no strength to perform ordinary tasks. I do not want to waste anyones time by going to the ED unnecessarily, but I was in enough pain to feel it best to have it seen to."

6587,"Accident and emergency services - Poorly managed - Came to A&E as recommended by 111. It seems normal that when you come to A&E you'll have to wait for 4h‚Ä¶ 4h30 in the receptionist tells us that the waiting time is now 5h30 maybe 6h. This is ridiculous. The processes to run an hospital are out of date, from the simple check in that takes over 30minutes, 1h before you get seen and then 4h30 waiting for a doctor. This place is poorly ran and the target should be 0minute wait, don't aim for 4h. It's time to spend the money on proper performance consultants and target zero waste! "

The staff were very busy with a full intake of mums but remained attentive and caring throughout. The care received from the delivery suite onwards was simply amazing. We required delivery by emergency C section. This experience was daunting but made amazing by the simply amazing team effort of everyone who helped our son enter the world.

The reception staff was not helpful at all (been told there is no ice or cold packs when after 2 hours we were given some). We were made to wait 8 and a half hours (!!!) without anyone telling us anything.

Arriving at reception on harpur ward we were told'only one person is able to visit a patient a day it's our policy' why were we not told this at the named testing facility? I asked to speak to the sister who was spoken over by the receptionist stating 'its our policy' I said who is actually in charge here? This is my dad we have come a long way to visit and he is very ill where is your compassion..the receptionist continued to speak down to the sister saying 'they arent allowed more than one visitor at a tjme' the sister clearly didn't agree but wanted to keep the peace....after my visit I asked the sister if my daughter could just poke her head in the door and say hello to her severely ill grandad which she agreed to. My point is...my daughter and I live together...we had both had a negative test at the dedicated testing centre whom didn't tell us about the one person at a time visiting policy my dad has had both jabs he is very ill...why shouldn't we both go into visit him? He is 94 and wont be around for much longer....how can a receptionist decide when we are able to see him or not? He is our relative by seeing us it would brighten his day... I understand the risk of covid but we were both negative the same as my dad and the receptionist was very rude whilst the sister in charge was lovely and had compassion but careful about upsetting her colleague...she understood the benefit to my dad of seeing us both. My dad is on his own away from home in a strange place family visitors can only make things a bit better for him surely? 
5226,Had an emergency app with dental team and the barriatric chair... Wow how refreshing to be treated with kindness and empathy
4126,Pre operation assessment sister was excellent.No need for improvements
8299,"The amazing staff on the delivery suite helped me safely have my baby, they worked tirelessly to make sure I was comfortable and I felt 100 percent safe knowing they were there with me! I'd like to especially thank Jenny & Aimee for the 121 care during my induction stage along with a couple of the students they had with them for everything they did! You guys simply don't get enough credit for what you do ‚≠êÔ∏è"
2776,The service was excellent. Prompt and efficient. No complaints.
6904,"Wonderful care, treatment and attention administered by all concerned to my husband when taken into A&E on Saturday Oct 4th. Couldn't fault anyone. Ambulance crew were also amazing."
3925,"Don't know - Need to get act together - Went for tkn replacement in april 2019, had pre opp, waited 12 weeks, then i phoned up, was told they had mislaid my notes, finaly found them, 12 months later, i got phone call to tell me to go for a pre opp so i could get other knee done, i got to pre opp dept, only to be told that whomever phoned me, hadnt booked pre opp for me, told i will have to go back, when this will be i was not told, this in my opinion is very poor, and not what i expected"
1237,"Long wait for results - My Mum attended a rheumatology appointed on 22nd December and was referred for an urgent x-ray on her hip. Fantastic that this was done there and then. However, we are still awaiting the results whilst she is in considerable pain. Sorry to say that this level of service is not what we usually get from The Royal Berkshire hospitals."
2178,Thank you to @ed_rli and ASU for keeping us informed and looking after my mum @UHMBT
7503,
4154,Not a beautiful building but when you need them they are there and offer a first class service. Yes you have to wait but that is to be expected. I don't mind waiting at all and have found their consultants to be excellent.
5597,"Service is average, very little care given to patients"
1290,Somthing have to be wrong when they send you home with an infection and paracetamol as treatment. 1 hour wating for a painkiller. Is easy to buy drugs in tthe street than get antibiotics for an infection in this hospital.
5902,"Counselling, an excellent experience - I have recently suffered from anxiety state and was referred to yourselves for some counselling. The experience was very positive and after a few sessions with the counsellor, I found myself feeling a lot better. My confidence levels had been restored and this treatment helped me a great deal. I found the online package rewarding and l feel that the whole experience was positive. "
5697,"Cardiology - Some Rude and Abrupt Staff - I was on ward 31 Cardiology as a patient admitted to an emergency bed, in my experience there were too many specialist giving different opinions to what was wrong with me which left me very confused. There was also pressure on Ward Managers to empty the beds, which is done in an rude and abrupt manner, when clearly patients are not well enough to be discharged . On a positive note some of the nurses were helpful and caring. However my overall experience of ward 31 was most unsatisfactory ."
1266,"Been waiting hours at North #Manchester General hospital for the Dr to discharge my Dad from the hospital, my battery is getting low. Kept busy with #Twitter & #YouTube, don't know what I'm going to do once my phone is dead. Back tomorrow as i need sleep once back in #Rochdale"
6726,"Sent to A&E by Dr. Dr. on duty, after a 4 hour wait, snapped at me and told me I should go to GP!! After x-ray, just dismissed me! No advice or care. The 4 üåü is for the other staff who where polite and helpful"
8158,
6484,"I would like to thank all staff who helped with my treatment .Professor Barclay and his team, Peter Clark and all their staff. All very professional made you feel comfortable and explained everything each step of the way. Thanks again Mrs s. Field"
2239,"We can't thank the staff enough for their fantastic care. - ‚Ä™Myself and my family would like to say a huge thank you to all of the amazing NHS staff in A&E, the staff on ward 14, ward 27 and the surgeons who looked after my mother Vivien. They all do a fantastic job, and we are so grateful to them all. ‚Ä¨"
6991,3 hour waiting time in the emergency department...
1084,A&e nurse helen 39 years old deserves to be in prison not winning an award in the future for saving a life just remember she took two away!!!! And abused a vulnerable!!!! 
8891,Worst hospital in UK .After waiting for over 7 hours with 5 years old child to be seen by the doctor.This hospital needs to be shut permanently and all the rude staff needs to be send home.
8607,"Went to Barnet A&E with a friend and saw Dr Kilian Hynes. He said he couldn't help us and that we needed to go to our GP (even though they sent us to A&E). We requested a letter to take back to our GP and he said it would take 30 minutes (We had been in A&E for 6 hours by this point). After waiting for over an hour for the letter we went in to ask how much longer, only to be told their printer was broken. So we were left to wait for a letter that was never going to be given to us. Why weren't we informed of this?? I would suggest jumping in front of a car so you don't have to deal with this guy. DR KILIAN HYNES IS ABSOLUTELY USELESS!!! "
5612,"This hospital is sadly lacking in communication between Dr / nurses and worried relatives.Have rung many times for a close relatives results etc only for many calls to go unanswered, and when they are, no information is given out to the patients son and carer .Not everyone has a mobile and with covid 19 not allowing visits, this is proving very challenging.Feel like been kept in the dark, try avoid if possible, How difficult can it be to inform the relative once a day via a 5 min phone call? The not knowing of a close members condition from day to day is beyond frustration .This not a pot at the great work Drs and Nurses do in fact very thankful to them in the past, but please let's communicate with each other."
9417,"The intake, blood test and walk to X-ray by nurse Justin was quick and helpful. After a 4 hour wait, the visit by Dr Obus was not helpful. We didnt get the full blood test result (he said my son was fine without full answers and I dont know how to get the rest of the information now). And although he gave us his time it was mostly to educate on other medical matters (what caused your headache, why did your blood clot, that hes anti-medication) or chat about travel, not to inform about my son specifically- why not to worry about other Covid complications, how he knew my son was past the worst of his Covi"
9811,Accident and emergency services - Disgusting Service - Arrived at A&E. In severe pain. An hour to triage. Waiting another 3 hours to be seen or any pain relief. Receptionist not on duty for over half hour. Told to wait till after nurse change even water waiting 3 hours. Also waiting for doctor to arrive at 8:30. God help us if we need emergency medical care!!!! 
1474,Don't know - Great practise in covid hub - Not enough praise given to the covid-19 hub staff- an efficient and supportive team who are always cheerful and make my experience pleasurable every time i go ( i have to be tested regularly) Amazing work all of you.
9308,Fantastic dedicated staff. Life must be very difficult for you all in these exceptional times. Clapping like mad! 
7711,"It seems that it is fashionable to slate our NHS, yesterday I saw a nurse practitioner within an hour of request, she advised to phone today for an X-ray I called my hospital of choice went along with no appointment but was seen and left all within an hour @WestSuffolkNHS üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª"
7647,Excellent from start to finish üòä
4099,Do not set foot or phone this place. You will be lost in the system forever.
5424,"Gastrointestinal and Liver services - Wonderful staff and services - I have recently transferred to Homerton Hospital for my Chron's disease and have been absolutely blown away by the efficiency, top quality communication and overall kindness and care of every member of staff I have encountered. In the last 6 weeks I have visited for multiple appointments across the hospital, including: - Gastroenterology check ups - MRI - Covid test - Colonoscopy - X-ray - Blood tests - TB test Each time I have received a letter, text and sometimes a call confirming I would be coming in. Every single department was smoothly run, even during COVID, the appointments were on time (or near enough), the staff were all friendly, kind and seemed to genuinely care. Having had a really awful experiences in other London hospitals with the ongoing care for my Chron's disease, sometimes not being seen for over a year due to appointment cancellations etc, Homerton Hospital has truly restored my faith in the NHS. Thank you so much to every member of staff there, your work is so appreciated and you have made a world of difference to me. "
7164,"Seen very quick, then x-rayed and treated with the up moody respect. Big thanks MIU Team HAPPY"
7978,Don't know - Great set up - Had my COVID 19 vaccination today. The whole set up was fantastic and well organised. The staff were friendly and professional. Well done
7610,"on the 15/9/19 i was taken to the new emergency department they have latelly built it was quite a nice new building when i went there i had to wait 2 hours cuz sick children were arriving on ambulance when i when inside the doctor said that i had to get addmitted to ward 24 cuz i had a swollen finger and it was getting worse, i started crying and the staff were so nice they gave me confidence then the next day they said i was getting surgery and that they will clean my inside of the swollen finger, i started crying more but the nurses were so nice and gave me confidence after the surgery they put me back onto the ward 24 and all nurses were so nice and the doctors were so supportive i dont know how to pay them back but i was really kind to the doctors and nurses and the staff, definetly recommend this hospital"
1010,"Thank you for opportunity to explain my deep appreciation for care and support you have gave for my father. Thanks to your care, patience and sacrifice you offer for your patients, my father today is feeling a lot better and I can say he is like a different man. He was very weak when he went to hospital but he come back to home on his own feet and now is active and energetic. I have met few members of the team in Clandon department it was very nice experience. Those optimistic and very busy people deserves our Thanks and deep respect. Warmest regards. Mark Szmidko"
2270,I saw a lovely nurse called Lisa who assessed my injury and she was so warm and welcoming. I could see that the department was really busy but she still had the time to chat with me. Lisa understood why I had to visit as I did not want to be a burden and took very good care of me. | The waiting times for other people that were there as a gentleman said he had been there since 10pm and he was still there at 7.30am.
8853,"Thankyou #pinderfieldshospital. Monday was ultrasound scan that identified gallstones. Tuesday was MRI scan that showed the gallbladder needs to be removed. Wednesday was a chest x-ray that showed pneumonia. Today they want another chest x-ray, can we skip to dress down Friday? "
3538,Just had my broken leg repaired at Whiston Hospital @sthknhs. Treatment was faultless and a wonderful sense of team spirit throughout the hospital. Thank you #NHS
9263,1 -very good | My whole experience was very excellent and the nursing staff were very caring -the whole experience was of a high standard Thank you
6338,Don't you think it's about time to stop using plastics and revert to paper and cardboard? The life span of covid 19 lives only 1/3 as long on cardboard and paper than plastic. 24 hours. If only a paper or cardboard sheath to prevent contamination. @BenPBradshaw @RDEhospitals https://t.co / KCWrbed98u
886,There's nothing more sobering than a visit to the children's wards üíî My youngest son had surgery today and I can't praise the staff at @TeamQEH enough. Truly amazing. He has come home with dreams of being a doctor. https://t.co/9g5osn19jT
1439,The hospital word bed manager just called told me I was booked in for tomorrow for quite major surgery! Would have been nice to get some notice. It's not going ahead now. I told them as a single parent I need some notice! Now I don't know when it will happen! @OUHospitals
7294,Everyone was friendly and tries to put you at ease.

9994,Ophthalmology - staff were kind and thoughtful and my treatment was great - I recently had an out-patient appointment for a Lucentis injection into the eye. I was quite apprehensive prior to the appointment but all of the staff went out of their way to reassure me and to make sure that the procedure was as efficient and painless as possible. I can't praise them highly enough. Thank-you.
1669,Maternity services - Great service - I had a baby on the 1st of September and I just wanted to appreciate the night staff that were on ward 33 that night. My little boys temperature was struggling to stay up and I had had strep b so I was a bit panicky but they were so patient and explained everything and support was amazing especially at a time when one could not have family around. I really want to applaud the ward 31 and 33 staff for all their care and support . You made it all easier through a very difficult time. 
732,Cataract Surgery - Cataracts - I was referred re my cateracts in October and as they are getting worse my mental health is deteriorating. I work full time and it is getting more and more difficult to do as I work with children with complex special needs. The actual work along with the use of computers etc has meant that I have a headache everyday. I do understand that covid has had a major impact on our NHS but can't get any answers as to how long the wait may be. I'm thinking I'm going to have to be signed off work and I have never done this in my life. Many thanks.

6894,"I rated the experience with a 1, I couldnt think of anything else to say. I have never had any had bad experiences in any department in the Royal Surrey. Apart from the expense and lack of parking. (Thank you Tesco)."
7755,"Every person dealing with me was cheerful, caring and reassuring. Every time I have been treated I have been very impressed with the care afforded to me. | Nothing - the service and care I have received has been superb."

7326,"Didnt have to wait long, good doctor  | Dilute pop in waiting room"
3295,4 especially reception is not friendly | ÔøΩI first call ambulance answer is we are busy. Can available in 2-3 hours. At that time I was vertigo and fell down. I had to call taxi to send me. Recept | ÔøΩion there are two ladies there do nothing. No patient waiting. I hardly walked to desk. But be told can you stand there and wait. I lost balance and fell | ÔøΩ down again.. nurses are nice. Doctor is ok
7717,I said 1 because the service was brilliant.

1511,"I felt reassured by initial temp check and spacing of seats in waiting area. Xray were kind, helpful and respectful. Matron Vicky assessed me and was gentle, clear and I felt looked after. I was given pain relief. | Nurse Marie was thorough, knowledgeable, identified my fracture without the xray. Cleaned my cuts quickly and effectively. She gave me good advice about cycle protective equipment without being judgemental. She balanced humour with kindness. She read the xray. Had further xray of scapula taken.

7529,"Not enough staff. Visit not timed from when we arrived but from when we were allowed into the building (finally out of the rain) about an hour later. Not logged in, abandoned in a cubicle until after another 45 minutes I asked staff why no one had spoken to us other than to say that they had to close the door."
9113,
3693,"Anaesthesia services - Wonderful Anaesthetists and care in Recovery - I was extremely nervous having never had any surgery before and as such I was expecting a traumatic experience. I was in King George Hospital for a total hysterectomy. The absolutely wonderful Anaesthetists who attended to me both had a very warm and caring bedside manner. They completely put me at ease with their natural warmth, professionalism and humour as well as their obvious confidence in their field. They explained everything to me and made sure I understood completely what would take place. I was to have both an Epidural ( to help with pain relief after surgery) as well as General Anaesthetic. During the procedure they spoke to me throughout so I knew exactly what was going to happen and what they expected I would feel. After my operation, they checked on me numerous times, including the following day when they were passing through the ward to see other patients. The care I received in recovery immediately post surgery was also amazing. I felt very relaxed and serene in the very pleasant environment with music playing. Almost felt like I was relaxing at a spa rather than post op! The nurses were so very attentive. Yes that is their job but they clearly take pride in their work and genuinely enjoy caring for people. They were all smiles and so very lovely. I was in Recovery for many hours due to various reasons. I was worried about my family waiting to hear from me. One of the nurses went the extra mile to retrieve my phone from the ward. All in all a very pleasant first time experience. I do hope the staff involved receive this positive feedback. They really do deserve the praise. Thank you so much."

466,
2888,"Stroke - Cardiac and Stroke Unit - I was taken by ambulance to this unit. All staff I met were kind, considerate and caring. Nurses, Doctors, Porters, CT Scan, X Ray and MRI scan operators. My prognosis was I had a mini stroke. This was a shock bu by the end of the day I had really improved and was allowed to go home with my tablets and discharge letter with follow up plan. Well done you do a amazing job."
2003,Agonising 10 hour wait!! You need to rota more staff nurses after midnight and more Drs in A&E. I arrived A&E at Sat 6pm and didnt leave until Sun 4:30am and had to go back for a CT scan Sun 12noon and again had to wait 4hrs. To say the entire process was exhausting is an understatement and I am a generally well person. Its not healthy to expect unwell people to miss a good nights sleep because the NHS is inadequately staffed. What do we pay our taxes for....
5850,Orthopaedics - Wonderful staff - Thankyou to everyone at the fracture clinic this morning. From the moment of arrival all staff were so friendly and knowledgeable. It makes me so glad that you are there for us.
2503,Maternity services - Disappointed - Would never choose to give birth at George's again due to a number of reasons. One being the lack of advice for after care I received after baby was born. My baby may now have an infection because of this. 
5948,"We had a wonderful experience at BCRM. Everything about our treatment went smoothly; the staff were kind, supportive and nurturing. We always felt well informed with our treatment and procedure. We are delighted that it all went successfully and we now have a beautiful baby girl. Thanks to all the team! üôÇüôÇüôÇ"
989,Breast Surgery - Excellent care - Had Mastectomy 18th March. Aneasthatist team were excellent I was terrified and they made me feel very relaxed. Nursing team on Gate 34 were caring and attentive. All in all very well looked after.
6965,"My son had day surgery this week, the day surgery staff and anaesthetists were absolutely brilliant, they kept my son calm and were very understanding of his young age! Jane the nurse on the ward was amazing she really helped me and my son, thank you all for everything you have done for us."
3587,"Cancelled operation - My operation was cancelled at the last minute due to an emergency which wasn't a problem but the fact that the surgeon informed the staff at 3. 30pm to apologise and send me home, but they made me wait another three hours before a doctor came and explained what happened. I feel that I have been treated badly."
1209,Drove in got test Drove out no problem
1939,"First class hospital, very clean, excellent medical professionals. Only negative is cost of parking and lack of spaces, but it is well connected by public transport! I also think the new Phlebotomy Swift queue appointment system is excellent, as it saves queuing for long periods of time. I hope you will keep this system in place permanently, after Covid."

270,"Orthopaedics - Thank you for being there. - Just wanted to big up the NHS in general, great nurses and doctors for being there when we need them most. You never now when you might need there services, some countries do not have the luxury of this great NHS service, so a big Thank you to all involved."
2190,"They saw me within 30 minutes, the nurses were very pleasant and explained what did I have to do."
3250,"My husband is / was being treated here for cml, overall brilliant care by nurses and specialists, but today after spending nearly 3 hours again to have a central line fitted the doctors who sign these patients off are letting their patients and staff down by not responding quick enough to discharge patients who have been waiting a long time. We all appreciate that you have ward rounds and a global pandemic but patients want to get out quicker due to covid fear."
8504,"Amazing staff, friendly and knowledgable! - From the moment I walked in, the service was perfection. The friendly lady at the door took my temperature, booked me in and guided me through the sanitising station. I then took a seat, waiting briefly to be be seen. Once taken through to be seen, the nurse was wonderful, she took me through the full procedure, her knowledge was impeccable. The procedure went smoothly and we had a flowing conversation throughout, helping make a what could've been uncomfortable appointment very relaxing and smooth."
3136,"Orthopaedics - Wheelchairs - I was asked to bring a patient to hospital for surgery to a fractured ankle.Arriving by car I went looking for a wheelchair.None to be found anywhere, even porters could not find one. Eventually I returned to reception to ask for help. She suggested I get patient on crutches from car to reception and she would request a porter to convey us to ward by wheelchair. I could have purchased a meal or an outfit to wear but not able to find a wheelchair. This is a hospital.Please get your priorities in correct order!! "

6625,"My experience was really positive - at about 4 pm on the Friday in between Christmas and New Year I Had a fall whilst out on a run, and had a lot of pain in my finger which was also visibly swollen and bruised. I initially wasn't going to go to A and E as i thought i would be there for a long time waiting to be seen and if it was broken there was little they could do, however I was persuaded to go by my wife. My experience was really positive, although the A and E Department was busy i was triaged, had an X-Ray and treated in less than 2 hours. and was given a 2 week follow up appointment to check it was healing properly."
8605,"Breast cancer services - Amazing people and care - Unfortunately have had to use the hospitals many facilities over the last few weeks. From day one until on going treatment now being carried out cannot have had better treatment. All the staff and I mean all staff from cleaners to consultants and surgeons have shown the utmost care throughout. Information about diagnosis and after care superb, nurses have phoned us at home and are so pleasant and professional, just so helpful, thank you to everyone. Without the NHS we would have such a problem with healthcare in this country, where else could you get such first rate treatment and aftercare? "

3460,"Really efficient and friendly service. I had 3 different tests, saw 2 doctors and didnt have long waiting times at each."
4753,1. Thank you all. STAY SAFE
2933,"Avoid doing any surgery with these people They will leave you crippled I undergone 2 emergency surgeries for very little relief and they took out lamina. Which is old fashion surgery. What they had to offer was Spinal Fusion in my critical case. I was left with Cauda Equina Syndrome and weakness of right leg, chronic pain. Went abroad Paid for spinal fusion and now their mistake is fixed. P.S My personal experiance with them."
6510,Loverly staff  | Nothing 
3038,Caring staff looked after my brother with care and dignity until his last days with us. Especially Carol They have a very hard job. Thanks
7430,"Don't know - Thank you - My mother attended outpatients for 5 weeks, on a weekly basis to have a very nasty leg wound dressed and treated. The staff were always kind and respectful, and did a wonderful job treating the wound, which was very important as mum is diabetic, and also has lymphodema in both legs. The leg healed without ulceration, and without having to wait 10 days to see the nurse at the local GP practice, it took a lot of worry away for mum, as they offered to see her until the wound had healed properly. Thank you to all the staff that treated mum for their kindness and professionalism."
4210,"I haven't had my baby yet but I wanted to share my experience regarding the antenatal workshops. They have been absolutely incredible! Claire has done such a fantastic job of keeping them fun, engaging and informative despite being online. I thought I would feel like I was missing out with the face to face element missing but I don't feel that way at all. It has been great so thank you and well done Claire! Also the 2 midwives I have been seeing have been fantastic as well, always caring and listening. I'm still dreading birth but I feel like I will be in good hands!"
8676,"#chemofashion back at @NGHnhstrust for chemo. Staff brilliant as always. Never treated as if my life is worth less because of #Stage4BowelCancer. Very lucky to have our #NHS but needs adequate long term funding so it can cope with Covid, cancer and and other conditions. https://t.co/zewUELG0ZL"
4033,all the nurses were very kind
3451,Worst hospital I ever seen in my life the staff are very rude and the nurses shame on you
4658,Because of the way everything is organised not just during this pandemic but always .all the staff are fantastic
4362,"Throughout my pregnancy everyone was superb. And it really is a minor thing, but my blood pressure was high,this resulted in my labour being induced and an emergency c section which I was put under for. On my final visit to the midwife my blood pressure wasnt checked which I thought was a little odd considering how poorly it had made me. But that being said, all the midwifes reassured me that I was doing a good job and I would always use Royal Surrey for any future babies I may have. (Not yet though, need to get some sleep first!)"
4273,I witnessed nurses in my local A&E yesterday (over a period of 11 hours) having to remind patients to ensure their face coverings were in place. For god sake people just do it. #facemasks #COVIDIDIOTS #NHSheroes @ULHT_News
613,"Don't know - Security staff dangers - Security staff are not wearing masks correctly! This week I saw several of them with their noses exposed, rendering useless wearing a mask on their mouths. Who is advising them it is OK to do this? Who is monitoring and correcting this behaviour? There is no point making patients wear masks and use had gel if staff on site are deliberately breaking rules and causing unnecessary risk. This is unsafe! "
1369,"Don't know - Parking fines - I went to the blood taking centre, and it took 42 minutes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶12 minutes longer than the half hour free parking. Not really a serious offence. Yet I got a letter demanding a 60 fine, which I paid straight away, otherwise it would have been 100. I find this shocking and felt extremely hurt by the experience. Isn't it time you did something about this unfair system? "
7388,Staff Attitude 
1690,"God, our Father, look with favour on us made in the likeness of your image; remember now the Passion of Christ your Son, Our Saviour and heal your world our home in the power of you Spirit; may @BorisJohnson and everyone unwell @NHSuk @WhitHealth recover speedily. 2 Chr. 7:14"
3437,"The care and treatment was exceptional. - I would like to thank the CCU Ward at Queens Hospital Romford for the care of my Grandad. He was rushed in recently, when he was first brought to the hospital he was moved around quite a lot and I wasn't best pleased with this as due to the Covid pandemic, none of his family was allowed in the hospital and I could never seem to locate him and other staff members of other wards were quite unhelpful and rude. However once he was placed on CCU ward, the staff was amazing. The care and treatment he received was exceptional, he is home now and is still full of praise and admiration for the way he was treated and looked after by the staff on this ward. Being 80 years old, he did not have a phone so there was a lot of phone calls from all of his family to the ward to speak to him a few times a day as none of us could visit him. This was never too much trouble, the nurses have always been accommodating and so friendly to us every time we called. It was nice to hear them picking up on my grandads sense of humour and hearing them laughing and joking with him a few different times while they was passing the phone to him, it was so nice to hear the care he was being given and the way he was being treated, he is home now and still sings the praises of how hard the nurses and doctors on this ward worked. Medically, they was always happy to give me an update on his progress etc and I'm happy to say that the treatment he was given was always swift and has made him feel so much better. This is the first time he has ever been in hospital, he is a very proud man and feels embarrassed to ask for help or using the toilet etc but the nurses in here was so reassuring to him to ensure he felt relaxed and able to ask for help. I always hear people complaining about hospital food however my grandad who is a bit of a picky eater has told me that he had at least 7 choices every day for lunch and dinner and they was all delicious - I wish I could find a way to email the ward to thank them but sadly can't seem to find an email address so I only hope a few of them are able to read this at least. My family could not be any more grateful to this ward for the compassion, care and overall treatment he has received on this ward. He has told me over and over again that the nurses here were angels and grafters Thank you so much."
1847,Dear @GWH_NHS Many thanks indeed to your A&E Department for the splendid care given to my husband last night and the comfort and kindness that he felt when I was unable to be with him because of Covid-19 restrictions. The Portuguese doctor was superb and the nurses likewise.
4172,"Accident and emergency services - Outstanding Practice - Amazed at the friendliness and professional practice from the reception staff, triage, doctors and pharmacy. The best experience in A&E in my life. Saw triage after 10 mins and doctor after 1 hour 40min. Even in the 1970s-80s would have to wait longer to see a dr. No one was stressed and were always helpful during my time their even though it A&E was full - well done!! "
179,"Fantastic MEDICAL care but the link between the doctors and the pharmacy is broken. I was discharged in under 2 hours but have to wait 5 hours for a doctor signature for the pharmacy to dispense some tablets. I still cannot believe the 19th century paper system this hospital is forced to use but the medical I wonder what the point is of having medical staff available 24 hours a day while every other part of the system goes home? If we lack a 24 hour service then the technicians, pharmacy, porters, labs, management, maintenance need to be 24hr."
9529,"Good hospital, very professional and kind, all staff on wallnut ward was very kind and helpful when my dad was a patient there, like to give a big thank you to all the doctors, nurses, domestics, porters your doing a great job well done üëè"
9660,"The physio I had was wonderful after 3 visit, and the work I did at home I am on the way up so if all goes well will not need another appointment and a stick. Thank you."
9852,"And can I just say how bloody fantastic all the staff @barnshospital were today, I was in and out in less than 90 minutes and that was with X-ray and waiting for tablets Hospital very busy but all the staff were caring, polite and professional Thanks üëçüëçüëç"
4771,Appointment on time good skillful nurse
2565,"On time nice reception, great consultant good advice"
1001,"Went to Lloyds to get some decongestant, but was advise not to take them as I'm on some prescribed drugs that would cause me problems. Good service but had to wait for a while"
27,Absolute disgrace appointment 1030 got seen at 1345. Today follow up appointment which I can not make 1hour trying to get through to no avail. Si looks like i will give it a miss
8419,A lady on the ward had a very poor appetite = solution = invite her husband to come and eat lunch with her (as they have done for 60 yrs) result = settled lady eating really well. Individualised care @HCTNHS ‚ô•Ô∏è
7627,"Just had a very safe, quick & efficient nurse led pre op @MFTnhs The nurse was compassionate & caring & spent time listening to my concerns @mftchiefnurse feel I'm very safe hands! Roll on Thursday"
5342,Lovely staff and great service
6661,"To be truthful I didnt even want to give one star. My elderly mother has been admitted to your hospital again with pains and sickness. She has to stay in, shes been there all night and I've just been notified by my father that a bed STILL hasnt been found for her, that in itself is shameful. But on top of that my sister had to go home to get pillows for my mother as the hospital had 'run out of pillows'. A hospital! Run out of pillows?! Sort it out. Really appalling, cant keep blaming the pandemic for this kind of stuff anymore it's just shoddy hospitals etc."
6444,
8025,I did not attend the hospital it was done over the phone and I didnt think it could be improved because everything was perfect
6546,the nurses were very kind and let me ask questions
1841,Appalling service at this hospital. Poorly run and disorganised. One department tells you one thing and another something completely different. Nobody returns your calls and PALS were of no help at all and really didn't seem to care. I had heard this from so many people recently but didn't want to believe them until our experiences with the hospital. I just wish we were able to go elsewhere.
2702,the staff at EAU are exceptionally all caring [es] devoted throughout the ward and looking after my care while being in hospital being treated so would like to say thank you to all the medical team as you are doing an amazing job[et] throughout this time kind regards [name removed]
4985,Just home from Chapel Allerton hospital after having a mole removed from my back. Nothing major but the second op this year. I'm under the rheuma and derma teams. The care I receive is phenomenal. The surgeon today was lovely. Reassuring and very caring. Our NHS is amazing.
7569,
8652,I have been well looked after by the hardworking medical staff and doctors. All the doctors handled and treated my case seriously. Wonderful care and service.
4274,the staff are wonderful and professional
9681,great staff
6375,"I was seen in good time and everyone was lovely  | A nurse did make me feel bad for not yet receiving a covid jab, I wasn't sure if she meant to, but after I'd explained that I am under haematology and want to learn more about what is wrong with me before getting it, she continued to try and push it"
2093,Very good service thanks
8155,Just had my blood taken for the covid antibody test! Intrigued to find out if I've had it silently or not at all! @YorkTeachingNHS
8979,Was seen quickly and the staff were really pleasant and helpful.
7079,"Shout out to the incredible Covid vaccine team at @NNUH - the whole process was super organised and efficient, all staff were friendly and even gave out tea, coffee and chocolates as people waited afterwards."
3791,More feedback for @NHSHarlow @PahMaternity The staff were lovely especially my midwife Rhiannon. She was amazing & made me feel at ease from start to finish. I had to stay in over night and was cared for by a midwife named Krystina....Cont/ #birth #babies #birthduringcorona
7064,Staff Attitude 
2525,These wonderful people performed my liver transplant back in October and gave me my life back. Thank you.
97,The care and service provided for my mum was excellent. I will never forget the care provided for her and she thanks everyone of you that helped her.
3944,"Unfriendly staff - no empathy or kindness - The receptionist was indifferent. The nurse unfriendly, confrontational and argumentative. Left with no help given and feeling worse than when entered. So much for the caring professionals!!! "
1495,"I would give it 0 stars or minus if possible. My experience of the maternity unit this year was awful..the staff are unhelpful, unfriendly in some cases rude and unsympathetic when it became apparent my pregnancy was not progressing as it should. I would not recommend this place at all, I'd warn against it."
5632,"My mother had to go to Queen's Hospital for an emergency treatment, her blood pressure was so high and she got there at 11:30 and was not seen until 7:30 in the morning. While she was waiting, she had to sit down for the whole night, she could not sleep or lay down. She did not have her wallet with her and couldn't get home and was told some one will arrange for her to get back home but they didn't. At the end I had to get uber with difficulty. Staff were really rude, not helpful and not professional. Queen's Hospital truly is the worst hospital in the UK."
6646,"Everyone was very professional, caring and friendly so nothing needed improving."
1052,"Very busy, carparks expensive and access difficult if you don't have a disabled parking badge."
6957,Personally I do not like CGH It is old and has the feeling of death about it. Needs to be knocked down and rebuilt on one level or two. Not the easiest place to navigate around.
2359,"Absolutely appalling. - I attended an assessment appointment on 8th January and was told that I would be referred to the well being team and they would get me better. After 2 messages this week for a call back to discuss, no response at all. I have also left a message on the pals answerphone. Yet again no response. It has taken a lot for me to ask for help as I am struggling to cope on a daily basis. Surely a quick phone call with an update is not much to ask for? "
8650,"Gynaecology - Fantastic staff - From the receptionist, the HCA, nurses and doctor, every person I spoke to was so kind and professional It made, what could have been a traumatic trip, to a really positive one I was made to feel at ease immediately, and the doctor thoroughly explained everything as we went on Cant thank you all enough for the hard work that you do! "
8115,Staff were professional and approachable.Dr. gave so much time to my problem and explained every aspect so that i understood.
7823,The level of care was exceptional.
1434,
4401,It's hard to adequately thank the giants at Derriford's A & E for their kind professionalism after my frail stepdad's nasty head injury yesterday. It was a great comfort to hear mum say that he was in the care of the ‚Äúnicest nurse and doctor in the world‚Äù. Thank you @UHP_NHS ‚ù§Ô∏è
1706,In @StGeorgesTrust for my routine dermatology appointment. Looks like hospitals are open and not empty after all @allisonpearson ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

4318,Treatment after a stroke - I had a stoke and my wife arranged have me picked up by an ambulance. It was sent very quickly and I arrived in the QMC Nottingham within 1 hour. The help and treatment was very good and I went home after about 3 nights.
6446,Helpful staff and good treatment
6231,Lovely staff
3056,Tried ringing just saying ring back later no one available to take your call
8982,Went to pick up prescription both time's was in and out within a few minutes very fast friendly and efficient service.
6314,"Avoid this hospital A&e, you go for an emergency over the night and they keep you 5 6 hours on the coridor to be seen by a doctor, they don t care, why they don t have an emergency doctor on nightime? was the point going if they don t do anything."
2636,Why! it's not somewhere you like going to getting money off the sick or injured and the staff have to pay extortionate amounts per year to go and make a difference and save lives under very difficult situations disgraceful but saying that the Q Park staff are very understanding and sympathetic at Treliske Hospital All staff definitely should not have to pay it's not like the get paid enough as it is they deserve more than a CLAP üëèüòï
4486,Many thanks to @AiredaleNHSFT for such a quick x-ray turnaround yesterday.. Less than 30 mins from start to finish.. Ankle ligament damage.. Not broken.. üëçüòÅ
9032,"Don't know - Fantastic care. - I have had the pleasure of working at this hospital recently and a was a lovely experience. The staff are so kind and caring, everything is well managed, nothing is too much trouble. I heard a patient say that he hoped the staff at the next place were as nice as the ones here. That's a great compliment. I look forward to going back."
332,Went to ward 8 at county hospital yesterday for a hernia operation and from start to finish the nurses so friendly and helpful put your mind at ease They were brilliant under the circumstances they have been put through over the past ‚Ä¶
3406,"Wonderful service. - My Husband has been going to St James and LGI for the past few weeks, we have found there kindness and professionalism outstanding. We are going through a very difficult time but feel they are doing there very best for him. We would like to thank all the staff from the very top to the bottom how much we appreciate you all. "
2033,"Community mental health services - Wonderful! - I came to the hospital with my mum and paternal grandmother in order to attend the dementia groups which were run by three different nurses, and I enjoyed them all. I found it really interesting, and was obviously very grateful for the tea and biscuits provided as well. I also attended a Christmas event which was in the hospital at a later date, where we all got the privilege to listen to a group of children from a local primary school singing Christmas songs, and also join in with a Bingo game, both of which I really loved too. I already knew a little bit about dementia prior to the group from watching, 'The Story Of Tracy Beaker' when I was a child. This is because in the show, there was a girl character in who came to live in children's residential care after her grandfather who she had been with had developed dementia and couldn't care for her any more. I now know that despite the problems it causes, it's not all bad, since people are looking for a cure for the condition, which I hope will be soon. That plus there is a lot of support available for both people with the condition, and their relatives, such as other family members, friends and neighbors. "
1451,Like to say a BIG thank you to Lukman (security guard) for being so helpful! He noticed my mothet was struggling walking & Without being asked he got a wheelchair for her. On the way out he saw me struggling trying to get wheelchair over the metal strip in the doorway & came up to help out.
2087,"Utterly mystifying experience. Their team / head midwife can't wait to perform an Episiotomy on you before you've even decided. They never speak in plain English either, just pure mumbling bear in mind whilst you're going through labour and your head isn't in the right place. An Episiotomy should only be used as a last resort but Hospitals seem to be dishing them out like they're going out of fashion! What they don't bother to tell you is, your life is basically ruined afterwards because of the pain afterwards with any form of intimacy. It's a conveyor belt system and they couldn't care less about you as an individual. I wish more mothers and fathers spoke up about their experiences so more didn't have to needlessly endure this. NHS need to step up in this regard and launch an investigation."
3305,
3758,"My time in hospital. - Because of the possibility that i may have contracted coronavirus i was put on the ward designated for that. Although i wasn't allowed any visitors or out of my room i had my own en suite bedroom. All of the staff were courteous, friendly, helpful, professional and supportive and made time to answer your questions. When i went for a ct scan i didn't have long to wait and i was more than happy with the food."
7086,"Excellent antenatal care. Professional, super efficient, and fabulous care. Thank you everyone who looked after us on our impromptu visit, especially Nicole B."
1109,Small and intimate
1375,I wasn't expecting to be spending my weekend in @FrimleyHealth. My Appendix was removed yesterday morning & I came home late last night. Everyone from the ambulance crew to the porters were amazing. I'm still in pain but it will improve now at least #NHSheroes #ThankYouNHS
9638,"All of the staff were very kind, professional and considerate. The facilities were spotlessly clean and the whole system was very efficient. I felt very well cared for. Thank you! "
9012,"Happy #WorldPrematurityDay2020 - a special day for me and this little one born in April at 30 weeks.

2259,"From the moment I entered this ward, I was greeted by very helpful, kind and fantastic. They have gone all out to make me feel ease and helped with everything, thank you."
3596,"Accident and emergency services - A positive experience - I am an older woman and I had a fall with resulting injuries. The staff could not have been more professional or caring. They were under extreme pressure at the time, but I felt well looked after and the attention was thorough in the extreme. I was with them for 5 hrs, but did not mind because they were very busy and couldn't have done more for me."
1200,"Children's & Adolescent Services - The very best care - I had the pleasure of attending QVH recently and I found every single staff member to be an absolute delight to deal with. Calm, friendly, helpful, and informed, I felt like our case was always important (even though I know there were more important cases) and I can't imagine a more dedicated hospital. You should all be very proud."
9637,Because it was a good service
7829,Seen on time - excellent attention given
8842,Colonoscopy
3529,"PEOPLE PLEASE BEWARE Let this be a warning to anyone undergoing treatment Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust ‚Äì DO NOT DARE TO CRITICISE OR COMPLAIN. We got this message loud and clear. They will make your life a living hell! And your life is literally in their hands. They are like pigeons pecking an injured bird to death or bullies ganging up on the weak child in the playground, who should have known not to tell the teacher. You wouldn't believe how evil these so-called health professionals can be so please take care."

2500,1+!
7751,"Thank you RSH. Three visits over the last three days. Staff brilliant despite how busy A&E and Fracture clinic was. Frist class treatment @SaTHEngagement I timely reminder that the NHS is awesome and deserves our gratitude, respect and support #NHS @NHSMillion @NHSFutureFit"
1666,Landed at Gatwick and drove straight to @MTWnhs... still feels like home üè†üíö and staff still feel like family.
5736,"Accident and emergency services - Excellent treatment under most difficult circumstances - 20/10/20. Following my collapse at home an ambulance was called. The Paramedics team was very thorough and convinced me to go to the hospital. The A&E Department was also thorough, attentive and professional even though I had to wait some 9 hours for a bed to be made available. Mainly because I had to use a CPAP machine and a side ward was necessary. I was offered refreshments while waiting and enquiries were constantly made regarding my condition. Following the bed being made available in the Integrated Assessment Centre (room 6) I was looked after extremely well with all manner of tests being conducted. From support staff to nursing staff, Doctors and Specialists I was treated very well and professionally. The patience of all these professionals was excellent. The place was clean and all efforts were made to keep patients safe. The food in the main was very good (you can't make everybody happy) the facilities maybe could be improved. Wet shaving was difficult without plugs in the sinks. All in all I would not criticise my treatment but it would have been better if I were allowed some form of distraction to be brought in but this was not allowed because of Covit19. Well done A&E and IAC. Take several Pats on the back. "
5781,"Gastrointestinal and Liver services - Endoscopy department - Amazing staff, was very worried about the procedure but the staff were very informative and calming. Explained everything very well before and after. Thank you NHS "
7429,"Horrible service, made an appointment via the 111 number i said i didnt want to be waiting around long because i felt sick and didnt really feel like throwing up infront of everyone. When i arrived at my time slot i was told i had to wait and hour, when i questioned this i was met with a blank face and then a smirk off the receptionist. After my uncomfortable wait in the international health service waiting room. I was called in only to be met with a rude arrogant doctor who had a trainee docotor with him, they never asked if i wanted her present either. He spoke to me and my partner like absolute dirt. Arguing a about everything i we was saying. At least i got the antibiotics i needed that was about the only plus side to it."
4361,Very grateful for Emergency surgery - Five weeks ago I went to a muscular skeletal appointment and north tyneside general hospital during my consultation with the consultant I was then sent for a emergency mri on my spine at Cramlington emergency care hospital. Upon results later the same day I was then sent via ambulance to the R. V. I hospital where I was seen by a spinal surgeon. Early the following morning I was in theatre for a emergency op on my spine. If I hadn't had the op I would have ended up paralysed from the waist down. This was very worrying at the time. With the expertise of all the staff I seen during this time and a top spinal surgeon I am now five weeks post op and doing really well. The staff at all hospitals and ward 15 at the R. V. I plus the surgeon and registrar were outstanding in their care and knowledge. Very grateful to the NHS and its staff.
5550,"Clean, friendly, efficient, professional and effective. Great communication with follow up appointment and care."
5879,"I had my labor in this hospital. And it was horrible experience. Firstly they lied saying my baby is too small, because they had plan to put so many pregnant women in there, to finish headache quickly. They give to all of us medicine to go for false labor. I was absolutely disstressed to stay with 5 pregnant women who were shouting from pain one by one. I never seen in my life these type of horror movie. For one week couldn't sleep because of all those screaming.I was crying many times. When my own labor started I was in horrible pain and midwife left me and said she will be back after 2 hours. I was feeling to kill my self from pain. I had to call my husband so he left my older child with neighbours and came quickly. Very bad memories. I would never return in this place."
2676,This hospital is worst hospital in the world you can wait up to 8hours when you call them after 2hours they just forgot about you! 
5884,The staff are absolutely wonderful very caring and of course professional! 
3687,4h waiting time in the emergency. After this waiting time I was told to go thru screening again because it's midnight and they need to close. Whaaat?! ? You are a hospital and you left me for 4h in pain and then expected me to do what?! ? Stay longer?! ? You don't deserve all the rainbows & respect you are demanding!!! 
6272,"Staff were efficient, caring and knowledgeable"
3229,Don't know - Rude reception - The receptionist at emergency care is so rude I've been sitting here for the last hour and a half have not been seen he is not helpful and he is rude to almost everyone who comes in. He has told my husband that he can't be here with me even though its making me feel a bit better cos my head is really hot and I'm in so much pain my husband was putting his cold hands on my head. I understand that cos of there is a lot of people my husband shouldn't be here but there were another 4 people that should not have been here and he did not say nothing to them. And then to top this all of he asked me if I can move from my seat so someone else could have it. Had to go stand outside.this is unacceptable especially when u do it to a sick persons. 
9456,Many thanks to Sr Anu & the amazing theatre & DCU staff @JamesPagetNHS who looked after my sister today. You were fantastic & you make me very proud #ptcentred #compassionate
2106,"I was very scared going to Hospital during the current virus, Ive been isolating since March. But GP insisted I had to have the tests done.From arrival, during tests to departure I felt protected. Moving forward I wouldnt be so worried."
5561,Excellent very help I feel so safe there
1716,Ophthalmology - Don't go Ophthalmology department at royal Leicester Hp - Absolutely crap service! Had an apt for 6pm was then called too come in for 5.30 as they have a early apt! Got here for 5.30pm and still waiting too be seen at it's 19.30pm! Crazy absolutely ridiculous! Would never come too this Hp again‚Ä¶ even the reception staff have no idea why I'm waiting so long!

1195,"I strongly advise to avoid staying in this hospital if you wish to stay alive. I've had the worst experience in there for the second time. I have broken my leg and was transfered from Newham Hospital to get an emergency surgery. As soon as I woke up from a first anaesthetic in Resus, a few hours later i have been given crutches and told i should go home for the next few days until i get called for the surgery, while suffering from the most excruciating pain ever (triple fracture), living totally alone with absolutely zero mobility due to this broken leg. The orthopedic surgeon came at Resus and said that i will come up to the ward until the surgery and the Resus staff argued this decision. I finally have been admitted until the surgery and I've got it the next day. In the theater, the anaesthetist was in shock I stayed over 36 hours with my broken leg without repair. It seems the urgency of the situation has been neglicted. Once in the ward 12C after the surgery it all went well for a few days until i have been transfered to the ward 8C (Emergency GYNAE) totally unrelated to my condition and where the doctors in charge were not there. (Capacity in the ward 12C was very limited). In this ward, doctors completely ignored my requests, i first complained of nasty side effects with one vital medicine i have to take and needed a review, i could not take it anymore so the doctors did not come to review it for 3 days, and then agreed to change it BUT NEVER PRESCRIBED IT. I then got my medicines from home, to replace it until i get a new one, it has been locked up by the nurse and i could not take it. I want to express that due to this terrible negligence from these doctors, i'm now having complications of the surgery potentially life threatening. This medicine was supposed to help avoid them and required another admission in another hospital that is way better than this one. I also complained of UTI symptoms, nurses called the doctors multiple times for 5 days, but doctors never came, the 5th day, the infection went to the kidney, at 1pm, still no doctor coming. As an immunodeficient patient i could not let this infection worsen. ABSOLUTELY NO DOCTOR CAME TO MY BED FOR 5 DAYS OF REPEATED COMPLAINTS TO THE NURSES, DESPITE THEIR NUMEROUS CALLS. I had to self discharge myself after 10 days in there with no treatment, no discharge summary (i have absolutely no clue of what happened in my leg) and when I was waiting for a treatment to take home, an unidentified doctor came to my bed and said what prevents you from leaving? As an encouragement that I should i self discharge instead of helping me with my kidney pain and UTI. I have been told that i will get an appointment at the fracture clinic in 4 weeks, 9 days after discharge, i did not get anything and the doctors never sent a discharge summary to my GP. As soon as I have been discharged i have been to another hospital for the kidney, and it has been found i indeed had an important urinary and kidney infection and i have been treated there; this infection could have turned into a sepsis which would have for sure killed me. The physio team also gave me the equipment for home that this Royal London Hospital should have given me. They also ignored never damages in my thigh which i did complain for a few hours after the accident i had, this impacts a lot my leg and leaves a bit of uncertainty on wether i will be able to move the bottom of my leg. When the doctors did ward rounds, the rare times they came, it was only two minutes or less and they were not even asking how I'm going generally, they were just interested in my leg. This hospital is purely incompetence at all levels, some doctors are ok, some are not, it's only and purely you and your chance and not anything else. They are pretty unorganized if you compare with St Thomas Hospital. You just feel everyone does whatever it wants and do no follow a specific procedure or organisation. I am starting legal actions against these doctors. This is the second stay where i could witness this incompetence."

5194,"I come here regularly as I'm under treatment in this hospital, they do good but the problem is, they just think about their time not the patients, every time I wait more than 20 mins to see the dr from my exact appointment, through these couple of months they cancelled my appointments as we know because of COVID 19 once they send it to wrong address, and after a year of waiting I came to appointment today and got 10mins late as the road was closed, then they cancelled my appointment and said u are late . It's not really fair, I really wanted to see the dr, but no, if they are late, they just say sorry and that's it. I was driving for over one hour until I got a way to reach the hospital but they didn't do anything."
64,I truly impressive hospital with fantastic staff. The hospital complex itself it spacious and modern - with shops and cafes etc for visitors and residents alike. I spent two weeks in the burns unit hear - and whilst it was a horrible situation- staff went above and beyond to help and I'm forever in their debt. Lots of parking on site (this is paid) so easy for anyone coming to visit - it's easy to navigate (if not massive) and the equipment and functionally must be some of the best in the NHS. I entered via A&E - but was in a specialist ward with my own bed within hours. If your gonna be stuck in hospital- this is where you want to be. If you're visiting a relative then it's nice and easy to park close to the hospital and you should have no problems getting there. Food could be better - but it's edible - and you can always sneaks out to the shop on site!

8559,Breast cancer services - Excellent thorough service - I would like to say a huge thank you to the breast care clinic at the Royal Oldham hospital.

After care also is exemplary. Thank you for everything.

Not sure why this question was asked. would it effect the care I got? some of the staff were amazing but others unfortunately were not. When returning for my medication, I had to come back to the maternity ward, where other mums were leaving with there babies and I was empty handed. No baby in sight. One of the staff new I was coming and once I said my name she went to get my medication. The other member asked how my baby was... Well this felt like a dagger to my heart. Maybe it would be better to only ask how the women is - unless they see a baby with the mum. "

7976,"Staff member that made a difference - Turned up to A&E for my daughter after she had hurt her arm. She is awaiting an autism diagnosis, is completely non-verbal and has no communication abilities so struggled waiting in the waiting room and I was having to physically hold her on my lap whilst other parents and children who didn't know why my daughter was behaving the way she was, were looking. It was an overwhelming situation for us both. We were quickly called through for the initial chat and the staff member on realising my daughter's struggles made me have faith in people again. She showed me a care passport I could fill out for my daughter to make interactions with care professionals in the future easier and let us sit in a sensory room straight away with lights which immediately settled my daughter. She got me tissues when I was crying from the situation and reassured me. Her kindness has blown me away. I am still learning how to best manage this with my daughter and to have someone like this staff member, not only make help make things easier for next time but also quickly turn a stressful situation into one of reassurance and care, made my outlook on it all so much better. If there were more people like this lady in my daughter's future, I would have no worries for her. So thank you. I would love to be able to contact the lady to give my personal thanks so if someone was able to contact me at all so I can name her that would be amazing."

4860,"Care I received while I was in hospital - This August I had my Appendix removed by a full operation as it was perforated in 2 places, which the Doctor explained what they might have to do as it looked very nasty on the scan. Nurses who looked after me in A & E and Nurses who got me prepared and ready for going into theatre was absolutely brilliant, very caring. I was taken to Ward 34 where I stayed for 10 days every Nurse and Doctors and Physio Team who cared for me was very understanding, caring. I felt comfortable being there. Went home in early September I had 2 District Nurses calling to change my dressing on 2 separate occasions, but unfortunately I developed Sepsis so I was rushed back into hospital a few weeks later. Nurses and Doctors, Phlebotomy People too are amazing, genuine caring people. I was transferred to Ward 35 for another 9 days stay, where also the Nurses and Doctors looked after me again, nothing was too much trouble for any of them. The Ladies serving drinks and meals were always polite and chatty. Cleaners were in every day making sure everything was spotless! The treatment I received on both occasions was outstanding.

The Communications person answered my email immediately and as a result of that exceptional service and help, not only was I reassured that an appointment would follow, but the next day was offered a cancellation. The Communications person is a star in my opinion, as also was the ENT nurse who swiftly, and compassionately sorted out my hearing loss problem. I recommend Warrington Hospital! "

1590,I just want to say thank you from myself and my husband Jamie to Amber and Charlotte (our midwives) who assisted with the birth of our baby girl Ada. It was a difficult birth and everyone who helped on the day was fantastic and so knowledgeable. We never felt out of control or that a decision was being made without our informed consent. Thank you again ü•∞

I can still barely walk due to my HIP issue he didn't even look at. Waste of tax payer money."

306,Respiratory Medicine - Too anxious to attend Salford royal - On attending my outpatients appointment I was stopped by security and asked to put on a mask I explained I was exempt and I was asked to produce an exemption card which i replied I've never heard of such a card. He then started shouting aggressively and was very angry. I did however show his colleague my appointment letter which clearly states respiratory on it. I was made to feel humiliated by this experience and as a result will not be attending until this Covid-19 issue is resolved

I had to attend the outpatient department both pre- and post- lockdown for the same treatment. I'd never been to the RVI before and found the whole experience comforting. The staff were excellent and the hospital was spotless."

People who had visitors with them were rightly told to leave due to capacity, but even then didnt do they had to ask for people who wanted to be seen to put our hands up. It took 4 hours from start to finish, which on a week day I was surprised. I had a bad cut that was still bleeding when I arrived there, took two hours to be initially to be seen and then another two hours for treatment"
6413,"Accident and emergency services - Foreigner Receiving A+ Service - From the moment I was brought into the A&E, from triage to registration through to my stay in Major 10, I was met with kind, compassionate health care worked. Specifically, a particular doctor was wonderful. She showed general concern, as well as comforted me with soothing words. As I am an American citizen, the experience was vastly different from what I was used to, and she made a mental note of this and talked me through every step of the examination, investigation, treatment, and release from the A&E. I've heard mixed reviews about the NHS, but I have to say that during my stay, I was treated with nothing but kindness and my ever pain and ache was met with real concern. She didn't make me feel like I was being silly when describing my ailments, which some doctors and practitioners can do. She listened, and constantly assured me that she was looking into things. She checked on me frequently, and made sure that I was attended to as quickly as one might hope in the A&E. When the shift change occurred, she met with my fiance and informed him, as well as told him who would be taking over and personally made sure the new doctor was informed of everything. I was in too much pain and discomfort to remember names, but between the two doctors, and the nurse who aided me that day, I was made as comfortable as possible and felt it was a more personable visit than feeling like a statistic. I appreciate everything they did, and feel badly that I don't remember a whole lot due to my condition. My fiance was quite impressed (him being a UK citizen) with the way I was treated and spoke highly of the services I received to me afterwards when we discussed the happenings of the day. He informed me of things I wasn't even aware of, like how often the doctor, herself, came back to check in on me and kept him thoroughly informed throughout the stay. I'd like to thank everyone who handled my case that day. They did a fantastic job at making this foreigner feel at ease."

I had a baby sitter looking after kids and was told on arrival it was a 2-2 and a half hour wait. Over 6 hours I was there in pain. Also the baby sitter was not very supportive of this. Also we are triaged in the waiting room infront of everyone. A young boy had gone to kill himself off a car park. But was brought in a&e for help mentally. The poor lad had to tell the nurses in front of all waiting in the room. This is wrong. I will say there was a member of staff called bran who wa

9784,Breast cancer services - Parking Scam - It is deplorable that a private parking company is able to use the high anxiety of a breast screening to issue a 100 parking charge for using the bays right next to the mobile screening unit to park when attending a recent breast screening. In my state of mind I did not notice any signage warning that the bays were not for screening patients. A shocking breach of trust that highlights how wrong it is to sub contract the parking to a private company intent on maximising penalty charge revenues. It goes completely against the principal of patient care being of utmost importance to the NHS. My breasts get the all clear but my bank account is raided. Fiona Cook

Over the phone I was told there was nothing they could do for me, and that I should wait for another two weeks to see if I still tested positive or if I developed a fever to attend A&E as it is a sign of infection. No support, nothing. And more importantly there is No need to prevent an infection by simply checking if there is any tissue left and provide appropriate support to a woman, who cares about the person going through it, right?! I felt abandoned and hopeless, now I just need to pray to not get an infection. "

8788,Guided Self Help for Low Mood - Croydon IAPT - At the outset I was very cynical about the benefits to be gained from counselling; similarly I also questioned the quality and impact of conducting these sessions over the phone. I engaged in a six week course during which the practitioner introduced me to a number of activities / strategies. Some worked and some didn't suit me. The activities that worked for me have positively change my life. Post counselling I continue to use a number of the strategies to great effect.I am truly indebted to my practitioner. I would highly recommend Croydon IAPT. If you are considering counselling or have been referred engage with an open mind and commit. It isn't just about six telephone conversations; you have to work hard and actively practice the strategies in your every day life. Thank you Croydon IAPT.

7452,"Dentistry and Orthodontics - So far I can only rate Trelike Dental at a Zero - My daughter who is a teacher went to her regular dentist several times with toothache last year. She eventually had Xrays there and was told she has severley impacted wisdom teeth and would need surgery to stop the pain. Surviving on paracetamol for ages, she got an appointment for 6th of Feb and on arrival was told the consultant was off? Would have thought a TXT would of been nice to say that before driving to the park and ride, but what was more annoying was they could not give her another date to see the consultant. They said that they would contact her and tell her shortly. No apology letter, no new appointment date. She rang consultant secretary to be told they didnt know? Long story short, pain getting worse daily, paracetemol no longer helping and she is in 9 out of 10 pain and after rining 111 etc as was after hours she ends up having to go to A&E. They gave prescription meds which help, but still is continually getting worse and they said she need surgery to remove them asap. She went back to consultant secretary again who said they still have no rescheduled date, will let her know by end of Feb? She explained been back to dentist, A&E and needs help sooner than later, but told she will have to wait till end of Feb for another date to see consultant? Back to dentist as pain getting worse and swelling, dentist prescribes anti biotics, says to chase consultant secretary, explain that she is in agony and needs urgent care. Secretary says that still cant give a date, so it goes on. Last night she came in from work and she couldnt speak she was in excrutiating pain, tried ice pack, hot water bottle etc, in end she had no choice to go back to A&E and get more prescribed pain killers! So far its cost her more, the Hospital more and this will continue till these impacted wisdom teeth are surgically removed. Maybe might be good to use the TXT appointment system to let patients know when appointments are cancelled too. Any way in the meantime my daughter has to endure excrutiating pain, take heavy pain meds and there seems to be no other solution. She and her partner have even seriously thought about taking her teeth out at home, as she really is at the end of her tether. Hope it does not come to that. "
4601,"Obstetrics And Gynaecology - Care and kindness - I accompanied my daughter for her appointment at the Colposcopy department today, and wanted to express my gratitude to the whole department, from the welcome to the procedure.

4323,"Horrendous Experience - I attended the practice yesterday for a coil to be fitted I was incredibly nervous as this process is incredibly invasive and having been a victim of sexual assault this added to my anxiety immensely. The receptionists informed me that yet again the computers were down having been so a few months before when I was meant to have the treatment, I was left unsure whether I would have the treatment but after asking I was told I would. I was so nervous so I took some water from the water fountain, the doctor then pointed to me from the reception desk saying ‚Äúis that one for me‚Äù. She called me in and so I left my water cup on the floor under my seat to which she said aggressively ‚Äúwas that full‚Äù I said ‚Äúyes‚Äù she then rolled her eyes and exhaled loudly. She led me into the room where she had to ask lots of questions as the computers were down, she was aggressive and blunt especially when asking ‚Äúhave you ever been pregnant including miscarriages abortions etc‚Äù this was an extremely unsympathetic and insensitive way to ask for the many women who would have experienced this and I was appalled. I accidentally said November instead of December, when asked about my last period, when I corrected this error she grew very frustrated and said ‚Äúyou didn't say that you said November‚Äù. She was rushed with her information and it just seemed like I was a nuisance, she didn't seem to trust anything I was saying. I was given the job of moving the seat up and down I accidentally pressed the wrong button and she almost shouted ‚Äúno not that one ughh‚Äù. The doctor was insensitive, she made my anxiety so much worse, she didn't talk me through clearly and slowly what was happening. She should not be working in a sexual health clinic where thousands upon thousands of people will be nervous for whatever reason whether that be their past experience of sexual violence or just nerves for the treatment. I was appalled and actually cried in the toilet when I was taking a urine sample. I would've put her attitude down to her having a bad day but I experienced the exact same attitude with her when I was meant to get my coil fitted the first time. She pointed at my boyfriend with an angry look and said ‚Äúthis the boyfriend‚Äù, she did not apologise for me having to wait and being confused about the computer situation. Yet again she was rude and uncaring. I was so upset after my procedure and have thought about it immensely, this woman has the power to do so much good in peoples lives yet she acts like her patients are worthless time wasters . My friends have all had similar experiences. I will not be returning for fear of getting this doctor again and her nurse who equally laughed at me for moving to far over the edge of the seat when I had never had anything like this done before. This review will be followed by a formal complaint, for my sake and for all the vulnerable people this woman will be dealing with these issues have to change. I would recommend to avoid this doctor at all costs. "

I think every A&E in the country should do this. It was a long wait due to to a lot of people attending but when he was seen the medical team were very efficient and kind. We appreciate so much the pressure they must work under every day to perform such important work. I only hope that the general public help our medical professionals by not attending A&E unnecessarily as it means a longer wait for people that really need it.

6533,"Don't know - A&E not fit for purpose!! - 111 said I need to be seen ASAP last night and would send an ambulance, my other half took me to a&e instead where 111 had not informed them I would be coming even though they were aware, I was then told I need an ecg and blood test waited ages mostly outside due to over crowding (including a continual cluster of ‚Äúsecurity guards‚Äù all huddled in the door way who didn't even have the manners to step aside so I had to side step my small body to get passed on multiple occasions! There was a guy with poor mental health kicking off and it took a grand total of 7 security guards and 6 police officers over an hour to deal with it in the poorest manner I have ever seen when it could of been handled by two in 20 minutes max. More so called guards there than patients but hours in I was still refused a bed even though I was in too much pain to sit and no ecg so I go back in and one of the police officer women is flirt chatting with the reception guy while I stand waiting to speak for ages past them both seeing me! I'm told oh we are busy you have to wait in an apathetic manner eventually and go back outside again literally squeezing passed the blockade cluster of oblivious so called guards so close they are all basically touching and I can't even get a foot of room past any of them at any given time. It's freezing and I literally can't face the pain of sitting or standing anymore so I go back to reception and say I've not had my ecg your waiting room is 2 thirds empty and I'm in agony so I'm going please send my blood test to my GP he says I can't discharge you go knock on the nurses door and speak to them I say I'm in pain so I'm going but he insists so I stand knocking watching three nurses see me and walk passed anyway and go back to reception who calls someone who says they've now decided I won't get an ecg for reasons they won't divulge and did not inform me that must literally be based on nothing and refuse to send my blood test results to GP if I go‚Ä¶ needless to say I walked out more unwell than when I went in. The most unprofessional cluster of money wasting I have ever seen. The only person of value was the exceptional nurse who took my blood. The army of gormless doormen taking up the majority of space completely on conflict with both Covid guidelines and basic human concepts of personal space is appalling. Oh and they send you about carrying a grubby folder as the entire place clearly needs a clean with a Covid questionnaire in that nobody asks you to fill in‚Ä¶"

4581,"Maternity services - Exemplary Maternity Unit - I gave birth to my Son 25th Oct 2019 16.08 on the Willow Suite. I felt compelled to pass on to the hospital / department and to other women who are planning on having their babies at Heartlands how hard working, caring and amazing the staff are there. Upon arriving that day It was quite clear how extremely busy the department was and I was told that Willow was full and I may not beable to deliver up there. I did feel vulnerable being in labour at that point and anxious that the delivery would be safe. Within 1 hour 2 Midwifes appeared in the pre-assessment room and took me up to Willow where I was fortunate enough to then deliver very quickly. The Midwifes present (one was a student midwife) were efficient, caring and made me feel completely comfortable. I felt totally at ease and trusting of them to deliver our baby safely. After the delivery, again the staff were thorough in their checks with our baby and myself, they gave us time alone together and assured us quite a few times that they were only next door if we needed anything at all. When the Midwifes finished their shift that day they came in to us, kissed us and congratulated us once again and wished us luck which I thought was such a lovely thing to do and finished such a special day off for us. It is a moment I won't ever forget. Once I was moved onto the Maternity Ward It was very clear how hard the Staff work. Anytime they came to check us each member of staff explained who they were and what they were there to do. The whole time I was there witnessing what they do (& im some cases what they have to put up with) it reaffirmed to us how Special our Midwifes / Nursing Staff are. We left a box of chocolates we had received as a gift when we left as a small thank you and again the staff thanked us and said no matter how small the gift it was much appreciated. If our thanks and praise can be passed on to we hope it will go some way in reminding them how special they are. This was my second child (my first birthing experience there was equally as fantastic) and I would reassure any Mom to be due to go to Heartlands to not worry. The staff are amazing and I could not fault them or the hospital for anything. If our thanks could be passed on once again especially to the Midwifes on Willow who delivered us it would be much appreciated."

He was in leighton for a couple of weeks where we noticed an obvious deterioration in his tiredness and willingness to talk. He was then moved to a specialist recovery place in stoke who said they were shocked at the condition he was in. He was dehydrated, on insulin that he didn't need and seemed to have been left there and since being at this place is so much better already. It makes me incredibly worried for if my family ever need to go to the hospital again. I do want to say the nurses we spoke to were always lovely and I appreciate the NHS in general is severely underfunded and understaffed but there was a noticeable difference between the two hospitals and we never had enough communication from the doctors here as to what was actually happening."

I was admitted for day surgery and everyone looked after me really well, if I needed anymore surgery I would opt to go back to this hospital. The anaesthetic team were brilliant and really put me at ease as I have not had general anaesthetic before. The consultant was informative of my procedure before I went into surgery and explained things well. Thanks again to everyone for working so hard, please pass my appreciation to the staff."

6953,"On Friday, 7th August 2020, my wife slipped on the floor on her hand. We called 111 and they said we will send an ambulance 2 hours later. She waited 2 hours and was in so much pain. When the ambulance came, he said you should get an x-ray and didn't even take her and I was 50 miles away and came a bit late. I took her hospital and she was still in a lot of pain. We waited for 5 hours and they didnt give her any painkillers even when we asked. There were only 5 people in front of us and and when the 5 people or so were done they called the ones that came later than us. We asked reception and they kept saying oh just two more people. She was in so much pain that we had to go and get medication from a store. Now we have to wait until Monday for our GP to open and she still is in pain."

We are extremely lucky to have a hospital of this calibre that continually performs so well despite the obvious pressures the staff are under. With many thanks, Catherine Anholt"
7073,. @StGeorgesTrust Supposed to have a telephone appointment at 1530 this afternoon. No call by 1630 so I call the hospital. One hour (ONE HOUR!) on hold only to be told they can't tell me anything until Monday. Wasted afternoon.

3486,"Don't know - Excellent care! - What a wonderful hospital! A large car park for a start which is so convenient. I attended the Pain Clinic and I was impressed by the efficiency of the staff on Ward One. Things seemed to go like clockwork. Even more impressive were the lovely staff who all introduced themselves and explained what they were going to do and what I was to do. Every person who looked after me on the ward and in theatre was friendly, pleasant and kind and a credit to our very precious NHS. Thank you to all of you for a very pleasant experience. "
1492,
4716,I have been looked after extremely well. Everyone has been so kind and helpful. I cannot praise everyone enough. This hospital is second to none. | I don't think there is anything that could be done better.
3243,"Accident and emergency services - Excellent care. - My relative was admitted to the BRI via A and E mid December.Despite the huge amount of patients in the department the care she received was exceptional.All staff were amazing-nursing, medical and non clinical."
3750,How long does it take to get a perspex screen in a #NHS trust hospital @RUHBath @CheeksterLisa? 6th July 2020 and at least one of your reception areas is still waiting. Unacceptable @H_S_E risk to staff. Get it sorted. Today please. @CNOEngland @Prerana_Issar
8341,Very rude and impolite i waited for 2 hours and nobody seen me‚Ä¶.
7091,You could not have done anything better
3033,staff all friendly and helpful explained what was happening at each stage procedure carried out on time with no waiting time excellent as usual i dont know why people complain about the nhs
8577,"I was at UCH SAME DAY EMERGENCY CARE DEPARTMENT today, went there straight after work as my GP has some concerns. So greatful to our NHS. This is one of the best institution in modern world. Everyone was very reassuring, caring. Sarah was looking after me, she is one of the best. We can't thank enough to our NHS staff, they work so hard, tirednessly. We salute üôèyou guys from bottom of my heart."
6569,"Accident and emergency services - Excellent care - I was referred by 111 to A&E with a racing Heart. I was fast tracked, immediately dealt with, monitored for several hours, attentive good humoured nurses (despite busy department). Kind, efficient, professional. Doctor gave me time and explanations. All this during the restrictions of Covid 19. Thank you very much."
1605,is extremely likely  Very quick to (initially) see a member of the medical team. Very quick to be referred up to the X-ray team. And then very quickly re-seen - with helpful analysis of the probleMs plus advice.  Happy for the above to be shared!
3152,"The service was prompt and efficient with good explanation of the procedure and outcomes. The post-endoscopy care was careful and provision of a cup of tea, sandwich and biscuits appreciated. There has been no post procedure discomfort. The only slightly negative observation is that the communication limitations with face coverings, and particularly wrap round visors, are pronounced with those of us whose hearing is less than perfect. By and large, allowance is made by staff, but not always."
2458,"Very let down - Refered and was told would hear within a certain time frame, its now been 10 months, just got an email from a 'Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner' basically say its seems we forgot you, email back if you need help or we are discharging you. What a joke. Im lucky I have a very supportive family who have helped me because otherwise, with just talking therapies I would have topped myself a long time ago. Disgusting service."
6403,"The 6 hour wait in A&E wasnt ideal, but understand it was an exceptionally busy night. There was a bit of confusion with which ward I should be admitted to, and I was moved about a bit, but all the staff I came into contact with were incredibly lovely and caring. It was only 12 hours from checking into A&E to being taken for my operation, all the safety checks were reassuringly stringent, and I felt well looked after. Staying overnight in a quiet side room was an unexpected bonus and the food was delicious!"
1026,1 - everyone so caring & helpful
3656,Arrogance and indifference of the A and E staff had no limits. I wanted to give 0. I will never use this hospital again.

5055,All staff were professional and very busy
6690,Exceptional Care - I cannot praise too highly the care and therapy available for patients who have suffered a stroke. This includes the care after leaving the hospital
6793,Poor service and long waiting times at UCC Urgent Care Center (even with a booked 111 appointment). And who's bright mind invented these rules in the waiting area. Ridiculous. I had to wait for 2 hours with my son and there were no space to sit next to him to comfort him. Nurses are rude as well. Unpleasant experience.
2513,"Clear, concise telephone conversation on on outcomes of operation."
136,Really friendly staff.
483,"Thank you so much for all the well wishes today. I've had surgery and it was a succes but took a bit longer than they'd hoped. Thank you @NorthMidNHS for saving my life, I love our NHS. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
5434,"Assuming that you enjoy spending hours lying on a trolley in a corridor like some subhuman creature this place is fantastic. (I was lucky; I only spent just under 6 hours like this but recently my 72 year old relative spent over 14 hours in this degrading situation. ) Follow this up with the fact that everything the A&E doctors tell you will be completely contradicted by the first doctor you see when you're finally transferred to a ward and it's easy to see why people are frustrated with the NHS in East Lancashire. Although, in fairness, every doctor who speaks to you on the ward will be guaranteed to tell you something different to every other doctor on top of breaking every promise / assurance you may be given. This may sound like a lousy review but in actual fact all the staff at every level, from porters and cleaners right the way up to doctors and consultants, are working their derrieres off to do their absolute best for every patient. Sadly they are up against a concerted effort by the Tories - aided by enthusiastic collaboration from the governing body of the hospital trust, who are mostly only interested in lining their own pockets - to keep the entire hospital underfunded, and more importantly understaffed. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that privatisation of the NHS is the answer - IT IS NOT!! The answer is to keep on at our politicians and the governing bodies of all NHS trusts to make them understand that the way THEY are treating US is unacceptable."
9556,"Superb reassuring, attention and treatment. Could not be bettered."
8315,"waiting times are very long. | By keeping me informed as to how long I would have to wait and if that wait was extended due to more urgent patients then telling me so,not making me feel like I am a bad person for asking,especially after waiting hours."
612,Helpful and efficient staff 
7747,"Considering the climate right now, I would like to show my appreciation to the hardworking nurses and doctors. Yes I had to wait a good few hours but given the circumstances, I understood. I was very distressed and scared but they reassured me and their communication to my husband whilst he had to wait in the car was efficient. The receptionist could have been a little more empathetic and calming but every nurse and doctor I saw tried to make me comfortable and get me the necessary bed or wheelchair. God bless the NHS"
1956,I was very happy with all the people I saw they were all very nice and helpful
7283,"I kept forgetting to eat in lockdown and it's become a problem with my eating, I rang the doctors after throwing up stomach bile over 4 hours and the nurses and doctors at #SalfordRoyal really helped me out ü•∞"
8210,"Yay! I can spring Mama from hospital on Boxing Day. Can't thank @SolihullUHB for all the care they've shown Mom on this scary cancer journey (tbf they were excellent last time too) She has a long recovery ahead, made easier by top-quality care she's had so far. #ThankyouNHS"
1641,"Big thanks to all NHS staff at Salisbury and SCAS paramedics for your care and attention. Don't know how you all manage to stay so cheerful and reassuring especially during what must be such a stressful time for you all - we are so grateful, thank you all."
9239,"Absolutely fantastic service! I had an infected tooth and couldnt get into a dentist. I had to have the tooth removed and am quite a nervous patient. The dentist was fantastic with me, it was quick, painless and very professional. Would highly recommend."

3593,"NCCC ward 34 and 36 - Over the last 3 years I have been a regular in the Freeman. I was diagnosed with leukaemia and ambulanced in from Cramlington. Admittedly I was terrified of what was to come, confused and feeling extremely ill. The team on ward 33 assessed me and I was taken to ward 34 to begin treatment the next morning. Chemo started and I spent the next 5 weeks as an in patient. The teams couldn't have done enough for me. Nurses cheered me up and not only explained my treatment to me but constantly checked that I was ok and always reviewing what we were doing so I could be as well as possible. I was then discharged and spent the next 4 month in treatment with short stays. The communication and way I was treated by everyone always excellent. I had regular appointments for a year until I relapsed and had to start treatment again! Another hospital stay and more laughs with the team on 34! I opted to receive the rest of my treatment as an outpatient so spent the next 10 months going to ward 34 a few times a week (for pretty much all of the day!) The ladies here helped me with side effects, gave me my treatment, discussed any issues and kept me on track for ten months (even giving me a kick up the butt when I needed it!) These ladies helped me physically and emotionally and made the treatment soo much easier than it could have been. We had some great laughs and I always felt they were interested in me. 33, 34 and 36 along with haematology teams saved my life twice now- not something that I will ever forget! Always with smiles on their faces too HAPPY"
6725,I spent all day at moorfields eye hospital yesterday and I can say it's fabulous we had a couple of appointments and everybody was professional and friendly and COVID 19 was high in place as you enter you get a new mask and hand santanizer and inside was so well organised yes I highly recommend this hospital it's one of the best I've been too.... And they have helped my brother see again thank goodness I can't thank them enough however we still have one more operation to go yet.... Thank you to you at Moorfields.
1608,"Heavily bleeding from my arm, receptions extremely rude, passed out due to blood loss? Last time I remembered was 5ish was woken up off the floor of the waiting room around 7ish? Told I was in the way and need to get up, shivering, confused still bleeding, minutes after been woken up I was taken through and looked after and stitched up by a nurse who was extremely polite and caring but prior care was terrible | The morning Receptions was horrible"

7150,I have recently been a impatient at st James and I want to say I get Ur short staffed and I do feel for u but firstly I have not been given my meds I should have daily the pharmacist was going to log a incident report then I was discharged while still throwing up blood no cause yet found not only that but when I got home realised u had failed to take my cannular out my sister rang ward to be told someone would be intouch still over 24 hours noone has contacted me so I will now be taking this further and trying to get an appointment at doctors to have this removed
1163,I must say how pleased I am from the moment I entered and the moment I left the hospital. I was treated with care and compassion. I was treated as if I was each of the nurses and doctor family and they wants what is best for me. Special thanks to Torna on the AMU ward and also Lorna. Brilliant staff. Very passionate and patient the same. TM
9069,Attended yesterday for my appointment only to be told that it had been cancelled.no phone call or text informing me of this.nhs go on about how much it costs for not attending an appointment well what about the patient who has to make arrangements.most unprofessional
6830,I don't normally bother with reviews but I was so impressed by the staff and the service I received I felt I had to. I went in with a piece of metal embedded in my eye. The nurse who dealt with me was friendly and efficient and had me fixed up and on my way in no time. Highly recommended. Plus carparking is free which is almost unheard of these days.
912,"We have just had Emily the physio and the OT (apologies forgotten her name) from QVH come to visit my mother. Wow, what an amazing team.

You all went over and above and for all of this I am truly grateful. You are all a credit to the NHS. "

From the time the initial call was made ‚Äî- I had emergency transportation to hospital, had all investigations done, had my ‚Äúarteries cleaned out‚Äù, had a ‚ÄúStent‚Äù fitted and was on the Cardio intensive care ward at B'ham Heartlands Hospital, all within THREE HOURS!

Rachel the night nurse on Surgical Ward 8 is absolutely amazing. She kept me cheerful. I was at PRUH on Thursday 22 July 2021 until Saturday 24th July 2021. Please pass on my heart of thanks to Rachel. X Surgical Ward 8 has only 2 toilets on the ward for bay patients and these include showers. Only one toilet is perfect size, clean etc. Other one is small and sometimes dirty. Second toilet is not nice. Added photos regarding parking in the hospital grounds."
9853,All great. Thank You.
7011,"Accident and emergency services - Good Practice - I attended A&E by ambulance. The ambulance crew were efficient, kind and helpful. I have been to hospital on several occasions throughout my life and have always found the ambulance crew to be the same except on one occasion. This Saturday the A&E staff were all kind and lovely people and I could not fault them in their approach. I felt safe and looked after by all of them. Unlike this instance, I did come up against some awful people on previous occasions but they can't all be saints, I suppose. I wish the bad people could take a leaf out of the good people's books though. It is luck of the draw who patients come up against unfortunately and this is shown by the various comments people have made. I have come up against real angel nurses and good doctors and most of them are kind people but the bad apples can give a patient a horrendous experience whilst in hospital. And I have experienced this myself and also another member of my family who unfortunately died. But I would like to say a big thank you to the staff on A&E on duty on Saturday mid day and afternoon of the 4 July 2020. I felt safe in their care and the doctor I saw could not have been any kinder, helpful or more compassionate than he was. I found all the nurses extremely kind, helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them. So thank you to these members of staff. They are a credit to the NHS and can set an example to others who may not be so kind."

8620,"Paediatric Surgery - Excellent standard of care - Our son has Autism and required the removal of some teeth . He attended Lyndon Ground today and the service was very efficient, friendly and professional. The bay in which we were situated was very clean and the use of PPE/ hand gel was visibly evident and used by all staff. The medical staff involved appeared to have a good understanding of the issues that can make such a visit very difficult for children with additional needs . Our allocated nurse and student nurse was kind and friendly . His post operative care was of high standard and my cup of coffee and biscuit was very welcome HAPPY. Covid 19 has made the delivery of some services very difficult however today it showed how well organised the staff / ward/ Trust are as we have received a high standard of care today to which we are very grateful ( Thank you ) "
2421,"Don't know - Radiology Department - My Mum who is 84 visited the radiology department on a Sunday for an ultrasound. She was over whelmed by the friendly staff, they were efficient, and went above and beyond to make my Mum feel totally relaxed and at ease. She could not speak highly enough of all of the staff she came in contact with on her visit. 5 stars. Well done team radiology. "

2653,"Went to A&E last night. Me and quite a few others waited over 7 hours and still not seen by the doctor. Upon asking what was going on, the nurses where rude and no help at all. Finally was told that there was no doctor to see me. Had to leave at 6am because my transport was leaving and couldn't wait on me any longer. The nurses couldn't say when there would be a doctor. I asked about the blood tests I had done and was ignored until finally after being persistent I was told the results would be sent to my GP. So I could follow up there. Worse hospital experience in a long time! "

2575,"Post surgery treatment - I was a patient for 4 days on a surgical ward (11 ). On admission, all the staff was very welcoming I was made comfortable. On the second day I had surgery and was bought back to the ward. While waiting for the spinal to wear off I was very happy I had the surgery. As the feeling in my lower half started coming back I started feeling a terrible pain in my bladder area. I told the staff and I was told it could be retention, a bladder scan was done and I had more than 900mls. The pain started getting worse, I tried to explain to the staff the pain was now radiating to the back area where I had surgery it was unbearable pain. I was told to relax it was retention. At this time the pain I was going through can't be explained, I was offered 2 paracetamol, and I was told that's all that was prescribed. I told the staff that I was told by the surgeon and the anaesthetist that after surgery I'll be in a lot of pain and I'll have morphine prescribed when needed. They still told me that's all that's prescribed. I know I'm not the first to have the procedure I had ( Hemorriodectomy), why wasn't it checked when I came back to the ward that the right analgesia was prescribed to prevent me suffering unnecessarily. After suffering unbearable pain I asked them how can they not know the after effects of the surgery, all they could say to me was that I should pick it up with the doctors the following day. Which I thought was a shameful response. If you work in a certain department you will know what happens following procedures. Please don't class this as a complaint because a was treated very well, but after having procedures, a patient depends on the staff to be their advocate, not tell them to take it up with the doctors themselves. That staff member's bedside manner is an embarrassment to the ward. I hope no one else has to go through what I went through."

3062,"Diagnostic Endoscopy - Like taking your Rolls to be serviced at Halfords - The facility and treatment seemed to me to be very basic but acceptable. I wasn't told who was a nurse, who was a nursing assistant, who was a doctor. There seemed to be ongoing disagreements between the person carrying out the procedure and the assistant. Before the procedure I had to change into a gown, but was then told to go into the main waiting room. I felt this to be inappropriate, protested and was allowed to stay in a small room. Would they have asked a woman the same question? I doubt it. During the referral process my doctor originally gave me no options regarding where I would be having my procedure. I protested stating the purchase of NHS choices is to provide the patient a choice of where and ultimately when the appointment should take place. During this discussion I was made aware that there were 6 hospitals I could choose from. My original option gave me a date in April 2020 and using the new referral I found the appointment within a week!!! Why didn't I get the offer of the 6 hospitals in the first place?? Poor show from my GP "

6240,"Nutritional support and dietetics - I was an inpatient at North Devon District Hospital following an adverse reaction to cancer treatment which resulted in severe diarrhea, dehydration, hypokalemia and reduced kidney function. The gastro dietician recommended a low residue diet, but the catering department were unable to offer this to me because I am Coeliac and need a gluten free diet. This meant there was very little I could eat in hospital which affected my recovery. I complained to the PALS service and I am very happy to say that my complaint has been acknowledged and changes will be made. However, there is no oncology dietician at North Devon Hospital and now I am considering restarting my cancer treatment there will be no one there to support me in ensuring my nutritional needs are met. I think nutrition and diet are such fundamental aspects of wellness and should be given equal importance to other aspects of care at the hospital."

Transferring a seriously ill patient from ITU to a ward where they leave BP cuffs on her arm till it cuts the paper thin arm of the patient & when the family complain about the bad treatment she is receiving, the nurses are rude to them.

7168,The staff are trying to do their best but it appears to be a very slow service.
5903,"This surgery is a liability and should be closed down. The list of their failings is long and very scary. Misdiagnosed ectopic pregnancy, missing medication every month (and I do mean every month), wrong medicines prescribed, lost test results, WRONG test results given, resulting in my child suffering, wrong scans ordered for a hospital appointment the list goes on and on. All of this doesn't even cover the 160+ calls I have had to sit through in an attempt to reach someone for an appointment! This has been their practice for the 17 years I've been a patient (not just during the pandemic) I've complained to the surgery manager before but no-one there wants to take responsibility."

9717,"Accident and emergency services - Excellent - I tripped over something yesterday and my head collided with a wall corner. I could feel a huge bump so my husband called the emergency services. The ambulance staff were brilliant and I have written to their department saying so. When we arrived at the hospital I was put into a cubicle immediately. I had a barrage of tests including a CT scan. The staff were brilliant, nothing was too much trouble. I saw a Dr and she was amazing, delivered the news that I wasn't damaged internally even though I looked a bit the Elephant Man! When I mentioned I hadn't eaten anything for 22 hours and am diabetic she went off to get me a sandwich (thanks to the people who didn't use white bread) and a big mug of tea. Although this was quite minor in the shape of things in an A + E Department it was to me, brilliant. She spoke to me as a patient should be spoken to. The staff who carried out loads of BP and ECG measurements, took a blood sample and did a CT scan were brilliant as well, they nurtured me. Fortunately I could be discharged and they provided a mobile phone to call my husband. This was my first time in this hospital as we have moved away from the tender care of the RD & E. They were also brilliant but that's another story. I know that the NHS come in for a lot of stick these days so I felt it was necessary to show their good side. Thanks once again."

6482,Health Promotion - Diabetic eye test - Arrived on time found department closed. Gentleman said department closed but perhaps it had moved. After having to go around building completely he took me to a different building. Because I have walking difficulties it took some time and I was told I was late. The eye clinic was not where the instructions said it was apparently it had moved. I was not told of this change in fact no signs were showing directing me to correct area. This resulted in me suffering pain in my legs due to the amount of walking I had to do. Can you ensure adequate signage is in position in future. Patrick McCann. 
608,"Accident and emergency services - Great care, support and expertise - I attended A&E on the recommendation of the out of hours Badger service. On arrival the ambulance area looked overflowing as was reception. I was quickly and efficiently taken through to the 'majors hub' with my wife. Even though I was feeling very unwell, with a blinding headache, light sensitivity and dry retching following an extended period of vomiting, it seemed every available space was taken by trolleys with patients. at 6.00-6.30pm it was not what I would have thought to be a busy time for A&E. Considering how busy it was I was seen incredibly quickly. This is not the place to give an account listing my treatment. The fact it included a CT scan, an overnight stay on ACU, assurance by overworked staff that we had done exactly the right thing in using their service even though the final diagnosis of 'food poisoning' was not as bad as they had feared is what is relevant. Following my treatment I have nothing but respect and admiration for every member of the team I came in contact with throughout my stay. In the early hours of Friday morning when I was beginning to feel a little more human myself, I became even more aware of the skills of nursing and medical staff working 12.5 hour night shifts. Diagnosing, treating, patiently explaining and supporting patients and family members. The response was as varied as the range of ailments being treated. If the staff had employed any less skill or patience I am sure the atmosphere could have been far more hostile. At 66 I am fortunate that I do not have to avail myself of many of the NHS services. Although I do seem to have made more demands in the last 5 years. I do not consider my self a very politically active member of the community but I do like to give praise where it is due. I could not have asked more from the NHS than that which was given to me at Good Hope hospital. As a country I hope that the recent political interest and promises to the NHS are held to account. Equally that essential related issues such as Adult Social care services are tackled promptly and in a unified manner. Not, as in the past, delayed because they are too difficult to handle. The pressure this failure was putting on Good Hope A&E team, throughout that Thursday night early Friday morning, could not have been more obvious. Yes, it will need to be paid for. Let us hope the time is right for these issues to be tackled! My thanks to Good Hope staff "

Hopefully she made it to the right department as I eventually gave up and came home. I am not happy that I had to abandon her but had no choice. Something really needs to be done about the parking. It took me 10 minutes to get back out to the road which was gridlocked due to SGH carparks also being full. This isn't a new issue either.

4870,"Uncaring and lacking in any communication. - Unfortunately, I feel that I have received zero care in my pregnancy under the care of Kings College London from the get go. The lack of empathy is absolutely astounding. On many occasions I have desperately tried to communicate my anxiety to the midwives, who have been impossible to get hold of. They give you 3 numbers to call (1) for emergencies (this is a mobile which on the two occasions I tried to call was switched off; (2) a direct dial which rings through to a receptionist who will talk over you and tell you to call the ivy green direct line (3) the ivy green direct line, which is a voicemail which is answered no earlier than 24 hours after your call..... all of this as you can imagine accentuates my anxiety. God only knows what would happen in an emergency. I have been sent blood results in an envelope with no explanation or cover letter. Appointments were changed and not communicated, at the very last minute to clash with scan appointments. I had 1 x face to face at 28 weeks pregnant but not told of the location of that appointment. when I phoned the assessment line to check, I was told to walk around the various midwife centres (of which there are 3 around 20 mins apart) until I found the location of my appointment. My one face to face appointment was rushed and it seemed that the midwife did not want to engage in any conversation with closed answers to my questions which made me feel like I couldn't ask the questions I wanted to. Every interaction I had with the midwives/ midwife centre accentuated by anxiety tenfold. I would be terrified about giving birth under care of this midwives team. I have luckily moved away, but rather than wait until I have transferred to a new hospital, Kings have told me they are closing my file - despite me begging them not to until I have found new care, as I didn't want to be without any care anywhere. Given that all appointments are virtual there is no need for them to close my file at 31 weeks pregnant but once again demonstrates what is in my opinion, callous uncaring and shocking treatment."
2982,"Don't know - Absolutely brilliant - I was admitted through A&E for the 2nd time in less than a month and while I spent along time in A&E Before being transferred they were very attentive, and right from the beginning they tried to find the cause of my many problems, spent time on gynaecology ward and gastroenterology ward, while I preferred the gynaecology ward staff I can't fault any of the staff, got a diagnosis of an 8 month long issue within 3 days and they've been great at following up with me as an out patient even considering the current world issues.

8139,"No social distancing and overcrowded waiting area - Attended for a pre booked scheduled appointment.I waited nearly 40 minutes to be seen, whilst other patients were in and out of the waiting room promptly. I understand it is an incredibly busy department but at one point there were 10 patients waiting in the small waiting area in which it was impossible to observe the 2m distancing rule. As someone who has been shielding I found this extremely uncomfortable due to the length of time waiting and the close proximity of other people considering the 15 minute close proximity rule with regards to time safety measures and Covid transferrance / contraction. Surely measures should be taken to ensure patient safety with regards to space / distance whilst waiting to be seen? If anyone in the waiting area is asymptotic then surely there is immense risk to other patients?! I work within the NHS and it is common policy to clean or at least wipe down seating areas in between patients or at least use antibacterial wipes frequently which was not practised either, would this not be advisable with the footfall passing through each clinic for everyone's safety? Unfortunately I felt very vulnerable in a hospital setting that should have felt safe in this current situation."

8337,I wouldn't give even a half star. I gave birth to a baby girl on 25th october 2021 in queens mary maternity unit ( west middlesex university hospital). I was looked after by team Ruby. The whole experience was dreadful and shocking and i would call it a nightmare. They leave you to suffer and you are given in the hands of trainees who get panicked when the situation is out of control . My post birth experience was also horrible where the midwifes were rude. I was inducted and it was a Kiwi delivery. Due to the suction used to pull the baby out my baby had clavicle bone fracture which was not looked after in the hospital. After we came home we saw baby was not moving her hand and her shoulder bone had come out. Even when she was admitted in the hospital for Jaundice the midwifes were rude.
9324,We were very happy with all the staff looking after us.

9392,"My first visit to zone 4 has left me traumatised and unable sleep - The ill-treatment I witnessed and received from zone 4 has completely traumatised me and I have been left feeling guilty for not saying anything because I couldn't bare the thought of another pregnant woman having to go through what I went through. This is my first pregnancy and my first time in zone 4 but not in my wildest dream did I think I would experience what I went through but on the bright side, I met an amazing heavily pregnant lady, we were the longest waiting patient in Zone 4, she had been there since 11am and I was there from around 3 or 4pm, I did not leave until around 9 or 10pm and this was all because we were waiting to see a doctor. I remembered asking the midwives to let me leave as I did not believe my symptoms was worth seeing a doctor for especially after been tested and was told that everything was fine but they insisted I waited. The only thing that kept me there was my maternity folder which they refused to give back to me. And not surprisingly, by the time the doctor finally decided to see me at around 9pm, they asked why I had decided to come in if I was only having an abdominal discomfort which I found extremely rude after waiting over 5 hours to see him, I then told them that it was my midwife who told me to come into zone 4 and they said I was fine to go. My horrendous experience was not only for the waiting time but how inhumane I felt treated and also watched other pregnant women treated the same way especially the ones in worst conditions. This is a new experience for me and I know I'm not the only one but I feel that one of the ways I can heal from this experience is to speak out. This system has got to change, it shouldn't be OK to treat people let alone pregnant woman this way. An hospital will not tolerate a patient's rudeness and disrespectful behaviour towards a member of staff so why is it ok for hospital staffs I.e. doctors, nurse, midwives etc to treat patients with such behaviour?

The moment we entered, the staff did not greet us or help at all and we had no choice but to find our way through. When we asked about our appointment, we received an ignorant reply and were simply told that our appointment had been cancelled. However, I had only cancelled a previous appointment for my daughter and I had not received ANY letter at all regarding the cancellation of the current appointment. When my husband called the clinic to ask and complain about the difficult situation they had put my daughter and I in, he was accused of ‚Äúscreaming and shouting over the phone‚Äù and the staff did not do anything to help. My husband also decided to ask for the name of the rude staff who had been complaining about us over the phone, but he refused to do so! Overall a disaster and will definitely not be recommending to anyone! "
2277,How I find my experience on the ward - I found the ward very clean and tidy my room was very nice and good size. The staff was lovely just don't feel there is enough 1 to 1 chats or support as it's too busy. I feel there isn't enough counciling to patients available. Also on admission I wasn't explained anything what was happening I had to ask to have a 1 to 1 so things could be explained. The activities was really good and the activities coordinator was amazing at getting me to join in which at first I didn't want to but with a bit of persuasion I joined in and felt so much better afterwards completely changed my mood. So I am thankful for that. From when I first came in to now I feel a bit of improvement in my mood and my way of thinking. The smoothies were a fab idea. Noise levels are very high which I guess can't be helped. I do feel though that there is not enough support with regards to talking to anyone for example on ward councillor etc. Also when patients do have a meltdown they just get left. Apart from that lovely ward. Also as a smoker I strongly think that fag breaks should be after dinner times. Tbh I felt I had the most support and time spent with me with the events coordinator so thank you xx

8699,Staff were truly amazing.. The wait time was very long but the outcome was that we thi k you are not seriously ill (luckily) so we are going to invite you back to a fracture clinic. I go to the clinic and am told we dont know why you are here all is OK with our bit of medicine so you need to see a vascular consultant but we dont have one. So go back to your GP and get referred to Frimley. The score is based on not getting a final answer just an OK in my silo so I am going to pass you to the next silo. My condition is potentially very serious so should have been completed to diagnosis

7874,"Caring and thoughtful nurses - I recently attended Heartlands Hospital during a deeply worrying time whilst pregnant. Unfortunately I was having a miscarriage. The care I received on Aspen ward from the nurses was faultless. They were kind, caring and compassionate. The experience itself was very upsetting, but I will always remember how wonderfully compassionate and empathetic the nurses were. Sometimes its the smallest gestures that really mean the most."
9385,"I worry she thinks we've all abandoned her - My mother in law was transferred from heartlands to Solihull 10 days ago. We have been unable to see her for 3 weeks and unless we ring to find out how she is we have no updates. She is in her 90's.We have taken 3 bags of clothes, glasses and teeth. She still had her jewellery and her alarm pendant on, where are these personal items. Today we have spoken to three different people who have told us three different stories about her being discharged to a care home which we are willing to pay for. Communication between professionals and family is disgusting it seems no one has a clue what's going on. Apologies today from discharge team too late, I hope they realise the worry and heartache that has been caused to my whole family. My husband is an only child. I don't accept the excuse that they're short staffed due to covid - that doesn't mean they can ignore families cause they don't have time. Absolutely disgusted.The whole family are away at the beginning of October for the celebration of my daughter's birthday. Before her fall we knew mom was taken care of in her own home by carers. The hospital now says she has to be assessed, what's to assess, she can't feed herself she's not mobile she can't talk how bad do you have to be. She has dementia and I worry she thinks we've all abandoned her. She's not going to remember we're not allowed to visit."

8326,"Urology - Thank you but..... - I had an appointment for cancer investigations on 30th June at the urology out patients clinic . Everyone was very professional. When I arrived in the clinic I was asked questions about coronavirus and had my temperature taken. The nurses were very friendly, professional and helpful. The appointment went well. The doctor explained everything clearly and answered my questions. Later in the day I had a scan which reduces my need to go back. I am very pleased with how things were handled and my care. Thank you. When I arrived and left I did notice that hospital staff were eating, drinking and using their phones without masks in the main area at the far end of the hospital. I asked the receptionist about this and was told that people shouldn't be eating there as everyone is meant to wear masks but it keeps happening. Sadly a disappointing blip to what was in other ways a very positive experience at a concerning time."

5203,"A very distressing time - I had a scan at Early pregnancy unit in RD& E Hospital in Exeter. My baby, unfortunately, didn't grow so one of the options it was d / c in the local anesthesia. It was for me very distressing time and the staff member who carried out the procedure was just not compassionate enough. Could not dilate my cervix enough and it was for me just terrifying experience. I was very upset so I just wanted to run away. The nurse wrote in the report that I was rude... I am sorry but I wasn't rude, I just didn't want to experience this. Anyway other staff on that unit was helpful a week later and empathised with me. I am myself in healthcare and I was very happy in the end with excellent care at Wynard ward."
6133,"I was rushed in to A&E for chest pains recently and cannot thank the ambulance staff and the A&E staff enough and they were amazing, I was very well looked after and supported In a way that was above and beyond the doctors were amazing and the HCA that looked after me checked on me regularly and spent time with me she didn't really have to make sure I was ok. The A&E nursing and HCA staff are amazing and work bloody hard AND I have my upmost support and respect for them all."

110,"INCOMPETENT AND CALLOUS STAFF Security guards, accepted 5 separate injuries into their Urgent Treatment Centre, and forced 2 of them with clear leg injuries to wait on foot to see a doctor for over 30 minutes, then when I finally reached the front of the queue, I was told that they were no longer accepting injuries, not because they were unable to or were full, but because they didn't want to. I and several other serious injuries were turned away AFTER WAITING 30+ minutes, because staff refused to communicate with each other. I've seen better organisational skills among amoeba; the hospital is not fit for purpose and the callous and unprofessional staff who started to argue and yell at each other and patients should be stripped of their medical licences to prevent further incompetency within the NHS"

My vitals were taken and a general form filled in. There was around a 5 hour wait until I was seen and discharged. I was given a bottle of water and kept myself amused using the free wi-fi and teen sitting room with xbox and playstation. Not exactly a holiday camp but I received good care.

And you can't get hold of the antenatal ward - it's 10 am I'm trying to call them to say I have moved to a different hospital and leaving their ‚Äúgreat service‚Äù for about an hour already and it constantly goes to voicemail - they don't bother to pick up their phone.

The food has most definitely improved though, but it's a bit rough if you can't manage to eat the sandwiches - it's a long time until morning - how do people with Special Diets get on? "

8529,"the opposite of caring - I thought health services are meant to be caring, hence the services they offer . I found the opposite of caring. Felt rejected, belittled, not listened to, has made me feel much worse in reminding me of bad experiences that I am now re-living. Felt like the therapist's goal was to prove I don't need their services, to discharge, to alleviate their workload, and not see me as a person, who has been on the waiting list long term for therapy.

5667,"Accident and emergency - Was advised to go to a&e by 111 with my adult daughter. We explained to 111 that I am her carer and her anxiety will be very bad if she is told to go alone so could I go with her to make sure she is checked and they said it should be okay if we explain to the staff on arrival to William Harvey hospital. This was as a result of a returned call as their urgent treatment centre was already at capacity for the night. On arrival, a security guard said they had to change their rules today as the result of an incident last night where they have ended up with more visitors than patients and that they had been reported for this too many times so have introduced a blanket ban on visitors even when I explained I was her carer, she said to speak to the triage nurse at the next door as it would be the health professionals decision The triage nurse came to greet us at the entrance and I asked if I could come with my daughter as her carer and it was implied that I was using this as an excuse. I was shocked by this reply and explained it is her GAD that causes her distress but could not give further details as I was cut off by the nurse saying they had a legal direction to not allow any visitors into the department. I asked what would happen if my daughter refused to come in alone and was told there were doctors and nurses in there - and they rolled their eyes at me. My daughter began having a panic attack and said let's leave so the nurse suggested that it was probably her anxiety anyway based on the little we had shared of her symptoms including a rushing, pulsing feeling in her head that had been ongoing for several hours and intermittent heart palpitations. Said my daughter could see her GP on Monday if she was still concerned. I stepped away from her to calm my daughter and ask her to consider going in but essentially she felt she had been refused treatment because they did not appreciate or consider the distress it would cause her to be alone in accident and emergency where we have previously waited 17 hours to see someone from the Mental health team. This was disappointing but also very concerning for people who may be turned away that have a genuine issue with being alone for a mental health disability. My daughter has PIP to support her and I am recognised as her carer too. If we had been asked, I had letters on my phone of evidence from the mental health team etc but we were not given an opportunity."

Had to have emergency laser treatment at Moorfields who followed it up constantly before they discharged me. I returned to P A H Eye Unit last April as I was still getting visual disturbances in my right eye and headaches. They refused to see me due to Covid but said see how it goes over the phone. My Visual Disturbances were getting worse so I chased up and was given a phone appt in Dec of which no one rang. I was then given phone appt 2 months later (Feb 2021). The doctor rang, didn't seem concerned at all and said I'd get a letter for a scan. No letter has come so just called Eye Unit and talked to very unhelpful person who said it wasn't marked as urgent and seemed very unconcerned. Got to wait yet again now. Just hope my retina doesn't detach as I'll be blind then! "

4555,A large hospital to the south west of derby with good road connections. Parking is not great so arriving by other means is preferable. I you do wish to park there is a one way circuit anti-clockwise where the main parks are almost at the end if the circuit The site is huge however access appears to only be through the main enterance. The layout is confised so it can be disorienting to work out where your destination is and how to get there. ask at reception. There are shops and concessions at the main enterance. The staff are very friendly and helpful.
2214,Orthopaedics - Some staff need more training - I attended out patients clinic 1 on the 3rd september. On arrival was spoken to very politely by receptionist. When it was my turned to be called a gentleman health care assistant Shouted my Surname out and said the words come on. I respect other people and would not use just a surname to any one. I had noticed he did this to another lady also. He was so disrespectful The team at outpatient 1 are normally all very polite and helpful

3812,"17 million people a year attend A&E when they could had gone to a walk-in centre or their GP. I had to attend A&E as I had an open fracture. Upon attending I was in a queue of two additional people. The first gentleman I heard him say he has an ulcer that appeared on his back in the last few hours. The lady in front of me attended because she had a papercut on her finger. The receptionist literally asked if she had come for a free plaster! Throughout the evening other people attended A&E including one women who had twisted her ankle. It isn't for me to judge what you think an emergency is, but the fact the lady with the papercut left after an hour is very telling. It is also hilarious that the same time-wasters are the ones constantly asking when they'll be seen whilst the people waiting with genuine and urgent medical concerns are waiting without any fuss. Such as the man with a broken forearm. Having had my joint put back in the right place, I suggested that I should leave and come back to have it stitched up the next day. The nurse stated that I was one of the ones that needed to stay. I hadn't realised the extent of the issue and that I required surgery! This was a Thursday evening. Doctors open from around 8:00am and if you ring them you'll be seen the same day as I have been no matter when I've rang my doctor throughout the last 18 months! There are also out of hour surgeries available as several years ago I attended one at 19:30 in the evening as I couldn't make a day appointment. There are also several weekend surgeries available. A&E isn't and shouldn't be treated as a doctors surgery alternative. There are already 17 million people per year wasting the A&E time and 180 A&E departments. 250 people per day per A&E needlessly and I saw around 30 of these people at North Manchester General Hospital! In my personal opinion, everyone should be triaged and if they're deemed to be wasting time (such as for a papercut) be sent home and no further treatment provided. Think! Before you ring an ambulance or attend A&E for non emergency incidents. You're wasting their time, your time and alot of money! "

Therefore, phoned Ambulatory Unit explained situation to nurse in charge and she advised me to bring my mum to the unit for review straight away. My mum was reviewed by nursing and medical staff, her BP was monitored, an X-ray was also done along with a review of her medication then discharged home to be reviewed by GP at later date. I would like to highlight the excellent service by the unit given to my mum who were very friendly, informative and professional, I was so grateful to them because her BP was dangerously high and her GP practice were refusing to review her. The Ambulatory unit could have easily told me to go to ED but instead they offered to see her in their unit because she was there a few days before and they remembered her. The unit and staff are a credit to Walsall Manor hospital and I thank them so much for my Mum's care. "
9226,"Orthopaedics - Fantastic Department - I had a follow-up hand appointment recently and arrived about 5 minutes before my scheduled appointment time. I checked in and was asked to take a seat. Out came my book and I settled down for a good read. I manged a paragraph when I heard my name being called. I admit I was a little surprised, but I was delighted when I realised I was seeing someone I had seen before. He has a lovely manner and explains things in very clear and simple terms. On examination, he holds your hands as if they are the most precious things ever. He makes you feel special and totally cared for. Possible options were presented and pros and cons explained. I was a little worried that by turning down one option I would be penalised, but he explained that we would only progress if I was 100 percent happy and on board with everything. I left, totally happy with everything that had been discussed and agreed. Thank you. "

3215,Generally most midwives have been wonderful and care has been great. I had one encounter with a midwife who (unintentionally) made some hurtful comments and I was discharged by her feeling nervous.Its been quite hard travelling to appointments nearly every day for first week postpartum but understood difficult with pandemic.
8435,Ophthalmology - Terrible system - I was seen promptly for stages 1 and 2. There was then at least a 90 minute wait to seethe expert. Is it really not possible to design a system that does better than this? ( I am still waiting as I type.)

But I would like to extend the upmost gratitude for the care my dad received from the ward staff, before, during and after his treatment / discharge. Thankfully my dad was in and out following an appendicectomy and even received a phone call following his discharge.

5628,Following a fall at work last week 2 Jan I suffered a badly fractured wrist that was also displaced. Went to William Harvey from Royal Vic in Folkestone so it could be manipulated. I was pretty scared about this as I was in pain and knew it would be a painful procedure. The staff who helped me were brilliant and with pain relief administered I did not suffer any discomfort. I was advised that the bones were still not in the correct position and so would need an operation. Operation today. Once again every member of staff I came into contact was brilliant. Thank you.

5311,"Ophthalmology - Extremely efficient - I attended for an injection on 25.5.2021. My appointment was at 10am. I arrived in good time but was quickly called for initial drops and escorted to the specific area. There I was given anaesthetic drops and iodine and after about 10-15mins was taken into the theatre. I was prepared for the injection which happened with little fuss but necessary checks throughout. This was an excellent improvement to appointments which relieved possible stress of waiting time and transport arrangements. The care and courtesy of the staff was exemplary and I do hope that this system continues. Just one observation - I was phoned with my appointment time on the previous Thursday. 20th, but only received the confirmation letter after I returned home after the injection on the 25th! "

The care, attention and information given to me has been brilliant. The diabetes clinic, the Maternity Day Unit (exceptional), the Labour Ward and the blood taking unit (always excellent).

I called them yesterday for an update as I've been on a waiting list since August 2019 and I was informed they had tried calling 9th October (but that there is a note on their system that I work shifts and to try again) and no further attempt has been made.

1910,"General Surgery - Very Unpleasant Experience - 3 years ago, I underwent an endoscopy at HRI. The staff were very efficient and caring and the whole procedure was almost painless. I have just undergone the same procedure at the same hospital and was shocked at the difference in my experience. In short, it was the most unpleasant and painful procedure I can recall experiencing. The only difference from my previous visit was the staff who carried it out, who in my opinion need further training. In particular the spray given to anaesthetise my throat was not applied properly, as it seemed to have little effect and I was left gagging and retching uncontrollably. As a result the rest of the procedure was rushed and painful, no doubt in an attempt to get it over with asap. Might I suggest a refresher course for the staff concerned, part of which should include practical experience of both performing AND UNDERGOING an endoscopy themselves so that they may fully understand the effects of their actions."

I felt every time it is completely waste of time to visit the department, They are not ready to listen to the patient's fears and concerns.

The emergency hall was crowded with children and babies, but the medical staff acted quickly and promptly with each case, including my 5 years old girl. She has been seen by 5 practitioners and doctors and the cooperation between them trying to find out the diagnosis amazed me. Very respectful, nice and professional. I wonder where do the medical staff find their strength in such a difficult and busy time? I only hope that my daughter's further health investigations will be at my expectations. Thank you very much Children's Emergency Department. You are wonderful! You deserve all the respect! "
6227,"The death of my wife - It took my wife, a former nursing sister with rather too much 'respect' for Drs, far to long to be diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She was told twice to just get used to her symptoms (6 out of the 7 for ovarian cancer) and what did she expect for her age. Only when she saw a locum and it was too late did she get referred. The GP responsible is no longer there. That referral resulted in chemotherapy but a subsequent diagnosis of 'untreatable' due to the nature of the spread. Apart from that the local surgery were magnificent, attentive and pro active. Even before Covid, there were issues getting her a bed in a cancer ward when it was necessary. However the service at Dorset County Hospital were great particularly the Chemo section. Ultimately she decided to come home to die although there was the offer of a hospital bed or a hospice place. Although my wife declined a bed at the hospice they were helpful with other things. It was a bad time when my wife was in so much pain I called out the night duty nurses but although there were drugs in the house the ‚Äòpaperwork' was not correct so she could not administer a top up dose despite the very evident pain. If they had left the house I would have tried to administer the drugs myself, even though I had no idea what I was doing Thankfully, the Dr who discharged her to home did answer my question 'How long? ' with the reply '3 to 4 days'. Then enabled me to plan to a degree but the truth was nearly 9 days. I thought I could cope but the 24 hour role was exhausting within a few days. I asked for help from Marie Curie and other nursing agencies but they would often say, We cannot confirm you will get help overnight until 4pm of the evening before the night shift. This was useless. I attempted around day eight to hire a nurse from an agency and they said OK but then cancelled. I was forced to beg for help from them and in the end they found me a most excellent experienced nurse who, in the event, was able to get me from bed just as my wife was dying around midnight. Her support until around 5am and after the paramedic had certified death and removed the drugs and the body had been removed by the undertaker was second to none. She also stayed with me until I was ready to return to bed. The fact I only needed to make one call to NHS 111 who were aware of what was needed was excellent. There was one issue during the 9 days at home when extra pain relief was needed overnight as Oromorph made her sick and there was some minor issue with the paperwork whereby a decimal point was missing in the dosage (although what the dose should have been was obvious (ie 1.5 NOT 15) whereby the night duty nurse, at 3am with my wife in considerable pain, declined to administer the pain relief without section from a Dr, which took a long time. Apart from this the palliative care team was really supportive. That was a very distressing time, not least for my wife. She had a colostomy on one side and a drainer for the Ascites in the other. At one stage, overnight when I was the carer she was in so much pain she pulled both out to try and get some relief. That was very distressing. During the 9 days there were fluids-ascites, created by the cancer that needed to be drained but it needed a vacuum bag into which it could be drawn. The surgery did not have enough and so this did not happen often enough. In the end I went to Joseph Weld hospice and asked the sister on duty if she could spare any. She was kind enough to let me have one of the two she had in stock and on deployment this brought great relief to my wife in her last couple of days. I took advantage of the counselling offered by the palliative care team from the hospice six weeks after the death funeral and that was the best thing I ever did. I even made the counsellor cry, but it worked for me after 3 sessions "

5630,"Including family and carers - A close relative of mine was admitted to the Hartington Unit and the family have not been involved in any care planning due to the suspension of MDTs. We have been told that the software Attend Anywhere is in the process of being rolled out but it really isn't good enough that families have to wait when they are a crucial part of a person's care. It's also unclear why other Trusts aren't using conferencing software available to them such as MS Teams through NHS.net accounts and this Trust is trying to set up something different. This makes me very angry as the family is being expected to provide care at home with no planning. A lot of this could be mitigated by decent communication starting with MDTs and including the family. Using Covid-19 as a reason for not doing so is not a reasonable excuse as jeopardises a person's recovery. I would welcome some clarification as to how and when this Unit will be managing MDTs that include families and carers, particularly through the pandemic."

They were like oh oh we didn't notice they're breaking the hospitals rules. Etc It was pure racism.

The teams are all aware of my anxieties and do their absolutely upmost to make me feel at ease. They take any concerns very seriously and are straight on to it. I attend for clinics and monitoring twice a week and live an hour away but it's worth it. I hope their post natal care is as good as their antenatal care. I wish all hospitals were as thorough with their antenatal care. Thank you so much for taking such good care of me and my special ivf rainbow baby. I can not thank St Mary's enough "
156,Although parking is a nightmare I was impressed by the efficiency and courtesy of the staff as well as the prompt and caring nature of my consultation
3014,"Most of the staff are nice but expect to be waiting upwards of 4 hours to be seen in A & E. A nurse that didnt speak English very well told me off for having earphones in when I was waiting, I took them out when I saw her come to the waiting area. I'm healthcare staff myself but im not going to spare you the two seconds it takes to say a name twice because I didn't take my earphones out quick enough, for four hours of boredom."
6626,Thank you the the two brilliant paramedics from @NWAmbulance who looked after my grandma yesterday üíú #NHSheroes
3478,"Don't know - Amazing service - Had covid vaccination today, i had no worries and concerns about the vaccination but i know a lot of people do but the lady why did my vaccination was brilliant and would set anyone with concerns at ease and all the other staff involved in the process were so friendly and cheerful, made a very early morning appointment for a jab very plesant."
9034,"Currently in SGH Maternity ward, honestly it's not as bad as you think here without visitors it's peaceful and you get one and one time with your baby, partners able to be at birth but to leave once you are settled and happy, doctors and midwives literally cannot do enough for you, appreciate all their hard work it must be so very tiring for them, Thankyou for looking after me and baby üë∂üèªüíñ"
7803,"My nan is being treated at Whiston hospital for pneumonia, she told the docs that she can walk despite not being able to for the past 10 years or so & ended up on the floor with the paramedics, never a dull moment with that woman üòÇ (she probably proceeded to make a sexual joke)"
4620,Because I saw a very nice registrar. I find it can be a really good experience or the worst experience depending on who I see.
4769,"Big well done to Breast Imaging staff at RHH @SheffieldHosp who were extremely efficient. I was early, they saw me straight away. All done and dusted in 10mins. Thank you Rebecca. It's reassuring services such as these are still running. #StaySafe üíô"
410,Fast efficient. And thorough
5070,Great treatment - I received a lot of treatment here on Mon 6 Jan.Both the young lady who performed the operation and the lovely nurse who assisted were great. They made me feel relaxed by explaining everything to me and talking to me all the time.Thank you both so much for being so caring

9312,Staff Attitude
950,The PICU unit here is just brilliant and I will be forever grateful for the care you gave my son. The staff go the extra mile and clearly all love the job. They give you reassurance and we trusted all the staff who we met. We were kept involved at all times in decisions and everything which they were doing and why.
3652,Had to come to @ED_SteppingHill with eldest daughter following her hand swelling after a bee sting - it's a 6 hour wait and as she's 17 she's not allowed anyone with her - seen by triage & her number taken & she's allowed to wait in the car outside with me #PatientCentredCare ‚ù§Ô∏è

4748,Really friendly and helpful staff
7962,"Accident and emergency services - Rude and disrespectful staff - From my family members admission last week for emergency surgery the experience has been nothing but diabolical. The member as admitted through A&E, had an MRI and operation and transferred to a ward that claims to specialise in spinal injuries and this is where all of the problems started. The staff have been nothing but rude and disrespectful to certain family members, and breaching confidentiality by telling patient that people had enquired about her. They are forcing family members to talk to the patient online and not get proper medical information when the patient is not the medical professional and has no idea what is actually going on, and this is an unacceptable and disgusting way to treat the patient and their family Breached trust and confidentiality by telling patient people had rung up about them (evidence is available for proof of this). Making family members anxious and upset is not the way that the NHS should be treating people. "
8562,
340,"Orthopaedics - Extremely poor service - I was discharged following surgery without the surgeon, or any other doctor seeing me. It is my experience than surgeons always see patients prior to discharge from hospital. My 6 week post op consultation was carried out by a different consultant who obviously had not seen the surgery note. The surgery did not alleviate my problems and in my opinion caused further problems as my foot became inverted. I would not recommend being seen or treated by the orthopaedic team. "
5783,
7901,"Worst secretary - I had back surgery at the end of July and in theory I should have periodic checkups to see that everything is going well, but my last two phone appointments have been canceled and the doctor has not seen and talked to me since October. for a week I have been in such severe pain that I cannot get out of bed and the secretary, instead of trying to help me, closed the phone in my face! I feel abandoned to myself, zero support or assistance, zero professionalism! truly unacceptable! "
3103,Great care for Mum @NTeesHpoolNHSFT today. She made use of a few departments and got covid jab too! Everyone friendly & supprtive. Clean and calm everywhere @lins_72 @karensheard24 Thankyou. Made a difficult day much better üôèüôèüèæüëç
8558,I had a epileptic fit and woke up 5 days later - I had a bad epileptic fit and woke up 5 days later in critical care ward and I did not know what had happened. The doctor came and told me what had gone on. I cold not believe what had happened if it was not for the help I got I believe I would not be alive. Even though the staff are dulling covid-19 they still went out of there way to save my life.
4310,"Had to visit A&E with my daughter this morning. I have to say the care she received was excellent. Steve in the A&E department, was fantastic. He really listened and was great with my daughter (Really cared and looked after her). He also made me a coffee!! We saw another male doctor from paediatrics ( i didn't get his name unfortunately) who was also excellent, and genuinely cared. A brilliant service, from arriving to leaving. Keep it up all, and thankyou for all your hard work through these difficult times"
2989,Was a gd hospital but has gone right down hill would not recommend as a gd place
4635,A stunningly good experience - I visited today to have the Covid injection. My booking was for 8:50-9:00. They opened early and everything was completed before my booking was even due to start. From entry to leaving the staff were fantastic. I don't think anything could have been done better. Manny thanks
4261,"The staff can be very happy rude!! They don't listen to you, they only assume!!! And that often comes out upsetting!! I think they need some form of training an development!! "
6739,"Staff were very helpful, professional and friendly. The provision of dedicated parking was a bonus and saved tome and stress"
3456,Signposting for the correct way to get to places using the one way system could have been better.Signing in points werent obvious.Waiting times were long but reasonable compared with other hospital experiences I have had.Most staff very friendly.
3923,Excellent skilled professionals who were patient and kind.

4521,"Absolutely ridiculous... Left in a corridor for 4 hours and still counting. 3 nurses came in 1 go and were more interested in Sarah's lovelife?! I spent a week in hospital back in August and it wasn't any better back then. If I start talking about this issues this place has I probably won't stop, so on that note...."
3377,#gotthevaccine this morning. So grateful to the scientists whose dedication got us here and to the amazing @NHSuk staff @WhitHealth for their care and patience. You all deserve Cash Not Claps. @NHSMillion https://t.co/j1NurKEPGh
16,"While at @JamesPagetNHS today, i asked the nurse (who took my pre specialist appointment obs), if she would take my pulse (manually), to compare results to my #Samsung SM-R800 The results were VERY close - within a couple of BPM, i was extremely impressed with the precision"
7928,who carried out the Endoscopy was obviously not experienced it was by far the worst endoscopy I have had wrong position and technique making it very uncomfortable. Otherwise my experience of the Royal Surrey was exceptionally good especially staff .
1193,Hope I don't have to go
443,The nurses and doctors explained everything they were doing.
5936,"Second Covid jab done @SouthTees . Again efficient and most of all friendly. @South_Tees_TCVs helpful and all staff great. 1st jab by physio, 2nd by podiatrist. #workingtogether"
1305,"A massive thank you to Shirley and Anju for looking after me and putting me at ease during an mri scan. So warm, welcoming and professional. Merry Christmas ladies x"
9052,Everything was as mentioned in the brochure.
753,
8588,Cardiothoracic surgery - Wonderful staff - I just spent a week on ward 27 castle hill hospital The nursing care was first rate The doctors were willing to discuss any worry's you may have Everyone I came in contact with just wanted to make my stay as comfortable as possible and get me back on road to recovery 
9531,The nurses / midwives at @RoyalFreeNHS Barnet Hospital are so so lovely. Made me feel relaxed although baby was giving me a scare. So hard when you can't have your safety blanket there (partner) but they made it a lot easier. Thank you.
7029,All the staff were very good at all their jobs
8527,The moment I came in everyone was so kind and got me pain relief very quickly as I had a discolated shoulder and in a lot of pain. All doctors and nurses very caring and helpful cant thank them enough
8622,all doctors and nurses were first class thanks
6363,"Accident and emergency services - Exemplary - My partner was taken by ambulance to Maidstone hospital after a collapse. He was seen quickly, investigated and reviewed by the specialist team. People took time to explain what was going on and the experience restored my faith in the nhs."
6351,"Very polite staff, great doctor who knows his job and knows how to assist patients."
5906,"Had a operation on my arm today. The staff were fantastic. Thank you so much to Mr Shergill and all his team. You were caring, professional and upbeat. Made an anxious time not so bad. Most of all thank you for taking my silly issues seriously."
9801,"had my x-ray and blood test today. Staff were awesome! they were all polite and helpful. It was so busy but they kept good humour. I don't think i can ever do what they do, day in, day out! "
6414,Poor care and communication - Staff on reception do not look up or greet me with a welcome very often! There is one radiographer who refused to scan my daughter as she was late due to horrendous parking queues. Inaccurate growth predictions meant we lost confidence and had to pay privately to go for extra scans at mums clinic in Solihull
5931,"Recent visit to A&E - I was well cared for even though the department was busy. I am happy with the care I received, and my questions were answered after having many tests run. I have a medical background and I could see the differential diagnosis process unfold as we went along. I'm as healthy as a butcher's dog and glad to be so, I just have some pesky neck muscles to sort out."
3203,I was attended to promptly and all the staff explained to me what was going on and the outcome of the various tests. Fortunately it was a false alarm but the doctor helpfully described symptoms I should look out for in the future.
56,"What an amazing hospital. Staff always friendly in clinic, recently i was admitted to the day case unit for knee arthroscopic surgery with Mr Hariharan, excellent consultant, cares so much about his patients. The day case unit nurses are brilliant, friendly and keep you informed of everything that's happening. Would highly recommend Kings Mill."
5824,"Very friendly nurses, attentive and caring"
5768,Well pharmacy need to make there staff know that old 20 pound notes are still legal tender. Two staff members refused to take it and said I could only take them to the bank. Good job I had other cash.
4041,"The worst hospital in London!!!! I took my 10 month old daughter to A&E as I suspected she had dislocated her elbow. As soon as I walk in I wait in the queue to see the receptionist. When I was my turn she was very very rude. I explained to her what happened and told her the my baby was in pain. She said that I need to take a seat and I will be seen by a nurse. The hospital was very busy as it was a Friday night, there was many drunks and accidents. I was then seen by a nurse and told to wait. I was shocked that there is not a baby / child A&E ward like many other hospitals. The nurse said that waiting time could take up to 5 hours and I should wait. Honestly I cannot be more shocked how can you mix adults with minor injuries alongside babies that are less than a year old with dislocated elbows and yet my baby is expected to wait up to 5 hours to be seen by a doctor. Take my advise and do not go"
4682,All great apart from lack of tea / coffee.
7264,Recently Went to Clinc F Emergency Department Amazing Doctors but unfortunately the receptionists were very uncomfortable and unhelpful They look at the front cover of the book .. Every human and life should be treated with same respect..
4458,"Breast Surgery - Thoughtful and caring - I accompanied a family member for breast surgery, following chemotherapy this year. The HCA on Stanway ward was amazing. She was so friendly and caring. Whilst my relative was in surgery I waited in the ward waiting room. This lady kept me updated every step of the way. It made a huge difference to our experience. Thank you. "
4938,
2222,amazing staff and doctors i am so grateful what you have done for me nurses are amazing
2442,"Great Practice - During this very difficult time we are all having with Covid I have managed to get my GP appointments every time I have asked for. That was through econsult, by phone and face to face appointments when needed. Many thanks for all involved in this process. Especially the doctor who is looking after me. "
9877,"Excellent communication, very welcoming, excellent treatment from practitioners, friendly and professional treatment. Such a good experience."
7154,no Queue Very friendly
5495,1/3 A personal shout out to the NHS who have done an extraordinary job fixing our teenage daughter after a nasty fall from a tree at @RoyalVictoriaCP : - the kind off-duty children's nurse who came to her aid and reassured her / us - the paramedics from @SCAS999 who treated her

1320,Staff Attitude
2281,"Everyone who is being let down should contact NHS England to make a complaint about the Mayflower Centre. The more of us who do it, the more they will have to improve their diabolical standards which were already poor, prior to Covid. Their inability to help people is causing enormous distress to patients and their families."
5171,"I'll start with the positive- the staff that saw us were amazing. My daughter badly broke her leg last week and the chaps that saw her, sent for X-rays and put her cast on were so lovely with her. Even if they tried to cast the wrong leg üò¨The downsides were as follows- we arrived at around 5:20pm, left 5.5 hours later. It took almost 4 hours for her to be seen. Stupidly I didn't take more pain relief with us, and after waiting so long asked 3 people for calpol before we eventually got some an hour later. She was in agony. Apparently they don't prioritise children in any way!! Another lady had been taken in with a suspected stroke. She'd been there 3 hours waiting. One girl came in and was sick everywhere from a nasty head injury. The sick was there for a very long time. Eventually some guy on crutches found a ‚Äòcleaning' sign to put near it as people were almost slipping on it near the front door. There were police men chatting up a girl in her dance leotard ‚Äòyou're 16, have you got a boyfriend' was one comment. We would've been there longer but a kind man who arrived well after us was called for his cast to be put on his wrist, he went and told them we should go first and came back out! It was like an awful comedy sketch. 2 stars for the staff we saw eventually."
8309,"4 weeks after breaking my elbow, I'm just about ready to resume my #CFR duties for @EastEnglandAmb @EEAST_CFRS"
7093,"Urgent care centre - Excellent NHS resource - My husband was having troublesome cardiac symptoms and the Gp had not responded after 8 hours. We knew the ambulance service was struggling so attended the MIU at Shepton Mallet. From the start he received excellent care. He was seen promptly by friendly, efficient staff. ECG and blood tests done whilst I waited outside. He was referred to the emergency ambulatory care centre at our local hospital and discharged with covering letter . At a time of unprecedented pressure on the NHS this service is a little gem. Thank you. "
1411,Thankyou to all the staff concerned for tending to my burns on arrival to the Hospital last Saturday. I am very grateful for the dedication of the staffs professionalism.
4308,"Experience with this Dr - Took my mother for a psychiatric assessment with a Dr at the Harland Centre last week and I wanted to complain about the meeting having come away feeling very let down by the system and my Mother being upset by the meeting. First of all, their English language was terrible and I had to ask them to repeat what they were saying many times as we could not understand them. I was not confident in this doctor's own health and ability to do their job. We went for my mother to be assessed on her state of mind as she is a year and a half in to an Alzheimer's diagnosis. The doctor asked a few simple question to me and not to my Mum, and did not do an assessment at all. I was simply asked about a couple of tablets she was taking and the doctor changed one of them. There was no assessment given and I felt like it was a complete waste of our time going."
131,A massive thank you to the Warwick and Coventry hospital for saving my aunties life tonight. üôèüèª‚ù§Ô∏è

7236,Gastrointestinal and Liver services - Thank you to the team - I was admitted following a flu like virus and with the current pandemic Covid was tested and ruled out as negative. My care was first class and i wish to thank all the doctors and nursing staff in woodlands unit for their excellent care over eight days whilst getting diagnosed an d sorted. Thank you NHS
1562,"Disabled Facilities - How can you have an A&E dept. that has no disabled toilet available. The staff escorted us to a toilet nearby that pretended to have disabled access, but a wheelchair user could not get into it unless the wheelchair then blocked the door from closing. once in there a user could not then get close to the toilet with the armrest down, or turn round to be able to lock the door. Surely amongst your staff you would have someone trained to know and understand what requirements are needed by a wheelchair user. This displays an appalling lack of awareness by the management ( not by the nursing staff who were only to aware of the situation) The staff assured us that they have complained about this on many occasions, but nothing gets done."
1156,"Maternity services - Incredible (planned) home birth experience - All of the team from Frimley, as well as those covering overnight from neighbouring catchments, were absolutely amazing throughout my daughter's planned home birth. The team of skilled midwives managed us with so much care and expertise. I felt like all my choices were listened to and respected, and we felt in such safe hands throughout, including during my pregnancy. The birth experience will be a lifelong wonderful memory for me and my husband and we are so grateful, and even more so because we battled hard to become pregnant (both our children were conceived by IVF). "
3643,Thank you for looking after my 88 year old mum as a NHS 111 referral to Urgent Care unit last night 11th June. Care and respect were fantastic. Wwll done to all the staff on that shift from security through to the doctors! 
4970,inpatient service was very good i just wish i didnt have to stay in the hospital
191,All the staff were both good at their jobs and helpful and friendly at the same time.
6873,"Urology - Excellent Urology Department - I recently had a cystoscopy to carry out a bladder inspection. The whole experience, from being received to being discharged was excellent. The procedure itself took only around twenty minutes and I did not experience any discomfort or pain. I was able to watch the procedure on a computer screen as it was being carried out and everything was explained to me throughout. Afterward, the surgeon in charge of the urology team discussed the results with me and told me what follow up treatment was required. All in all, a very interesting and informative experience. To any men reading this and are about to have a cystoscopy, or if you need one in the future, do not hesitate, it is a simple straight forward procedure carried out with kindness, care and respect in Airedale's wonderful urology department."
8959,I had two surgeries yesterday @NewVicHospital and simply cannot thank them enough for their kindness and stellar care. I cannot remember everyone's individual names (except Angelic ‚ù§Ô∏è) due to anesthetic amnesia üòÇ but a very loud thank you from the silly expat who was in Room 14.
7219,"What an absolute joke parking at @RUHBath is. Driving around for 45 minutes this morning and still couldn't find a space. Ended up missing my appointment. Why build a new car park (totally inadequate), then build on other existing car parks? #NHS"

All the staff have been absolutely wonderful and my care has been exceptional. I can't name people individually as 1. I can't remember all their names and 2. More importantly they are a team. A team whose smiles have made me really happy, they engage, are receptive and have made my enforced (my own fault) stay a real pleasure. I love you all. X"

1317,"Went for an appointment at @uhbtrust which had been turned into a phone appointment but nobody had told me, so I went into a COVID hotspot for no reason. Phoned the booking line to tell them who didn't know either, and apparently thought it was funny. Thanks for that btw."
5204,Thank you to the staff in a&e and Disney ward my daughter was admitted for a couple of nights and then had to go back for antibiotics for a couple days but the team you have on Disney ward is impeccable! They're all lovely and extremely good with the children putting them at ease and parents at ease in the unfortunate situations. The staff couldn't do enough to help and was very informative when asked questions. Thank you again for helping our little girl get better! We are so lucky to have the nhs üåà

2229,"I was admitted to the hospital on Sunday, discharged on Tuesday and asked to come on Friday for an ultrasound. Upon attending I am asked to wait for a surgeon. So I understand it will take a While I wait for 6 hours. When the surgeon sees me, she tells me you wasted your time we can't see you as the UV closes at 4 and it wasn't 'booked' and tells me there's nothing to be done. So I wasted 6 hours of my life even though I was specifically asked when being discharged to come on Friday to be seen. I have it on paper! I feel like crying and suicidal Can you imagine I was there and saw about 20 people come in and be seen just to be told I can't be seen. I regret being sick and I regret going to hospital wish I died instead"
7135,"Very efficient, sympathetic great treatment | Very efficient, sympathetic great treatment"
9497,Clinical Treatment 
6576,convenience of getting the blood test after the consultation
6958,I cannot fault the service I got from nursing staff and junior doctors but 9 hours was a long time to sit on a plastic chair in a waiting room.Senior medical staff very abrupt.
1903,"Helpful, non-judgemental, comforting - I came here for cbt / tfcbt and it was amazing. Some sessions felt unproductive but the overall change was outstandingHAPPY it probably took around 3 months from initial referral to the start of therapy which is better than expected and once you're in regular sessions are provided and contacts etc. My therapist was lovely and genuine, the receptionists were friendly, and I can't thank the team enough. Don't be put off by bad reviews- you have to try it to know HAPPYHAPPY"
9504,"The passive aggressive nature I felt on entry, I appreicate this is a very very serious and difficult time but I felt like a criminal and was questioned very poorly by two people as the same time.... luckily I was able to manage this without becoming scared vulnerable and or upset... maybe others can kead to anger in this situation... not helpful the staff at Emergency. A and E 2 need to be a little less aggressive at entry. I was wearing my own mask, sent by 111, was booked in yet received this treatment!! Really!!!"
1778,"Accident and emergency services - wonderful A&E - 30/05/2020. went to A&E at 5.30 am, with pain & blood shot eye, saw this Doctor who i wish i had his name, He treated me so well to sort out my eye did so many test's and said later today you will get a phone call to come back to see the eye consultant, 1 hour after getting back home I Did!! 5.30 pm I went back, I can't thank them enough Today 31/05/2020 I am pain free & know what went wrong with my eye .

8196,
2351,"The staff are excellent, very encouraging."
2066,"The standard of nursing and medical care was excellent. The ward was very clean. The patients welfare was always first on the agenda. The hot food was very poor, a couple of meals I had were really quite horrible. The cold food was good. The bathroom on our ward was very tired."
9838,Speech and language services - Great practice - I have had two appointments to see the Specialist Speech and Language Therapist in Head and Neck / Voice Speech and Language Therapy Department regarding problems with my throat which was causing me concern. My throat kept feeling hoarse after speaking on the phone or having to speak repeatedly. At our initial session the therapist suggested I practice straw phonation exercises which we tried out together and I immediately noticed a difference as the throat muscles relaxed. After continuing these exercises daily when we met at our second session two weeks later the therapist thought the problem had been resolved and to use the exercises when needed. We jointly agreed for discharge. I was extremely satisfied and delighted with the treatment I received.
7645,It's Myeloma Awareness Week and I'd like to give a huge shout out to @kimorchard7 and all the team @UHSFT for the brilliant treatment they've given me and countless others in the fight v #myeloma @MyelomaUK https://t.co / xMWmD2poZF
7993,"Cardiology - NHS at its very best - I called 111 on the 15th March from that moment on I had the best care possible, from the ambulance crew who were so kind, to Ambulatory Services, the holding unit ward, Cardiology and Barts. All the staff were amazing kind humans who treated me with dignity and respect as I felt very vulnerable. I was taken by ambulance to Barts for an angiogram then back to Whipps, the crew teams were all so professional. I have had a long rooted fear of hospitals. I have to have another test to be sure of the diagnosis. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. The nurses and staff in Cardiology were fantastic. We are so lucky to have our NHS."
7871,"Absolutely terrible! Today in emergency department!!!!! Careless staff, arrogant attitudes and lies aren't what you expect when visiting a hospital. whipps cross hospital!!!! They should change employees on reception and then next. . They refused give first aid to me husband only BECOUSE his GP is not from Leyton. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!!!!!!! "

9089,"Emergency Abdominal Surgery - Brilliant Service - Just had appendix removed, from initial diagnosis to surgery the service was excellent. I was placed on ward 32 and all staff were brilliant, kept me well informed and always wanted to know if I needed anything from a cup of tea to pain relief."
4487,Don't know - Brilliant and brilliant - Thank you to the team on the Surgical Admissions Lounge. Their kindness and care was unceasing. They work so very hard with professionalism and good humour. Special thanks to the lovely HCA and staff nurse. Thank you. It's much appreciated.

83,"An example of how not to run a hospital. Appointment at the pregnancy assessment centre was never on time, even if we were the only people on the ward in the waiting room. We had to wait 4-5 hours and this was a weekly occurrence. I expect to be seen when we arrive for the appointment to he scene. I expect to have communication or some sort of warning about our delay in being seen. Traveled an hour every week to be neglected in a waiting room then have staff that are as useful as a chocolate kettle see us. What's even more hilarious, is their complaint department is non-existent."

9489,"Hi @ChelwestFT! I need to cancel an appointment you've kindly made for me for 9 November as, since being referred, I've moved to Leeds. I can't seem to get through though (phone is going straight to busy ringtone every time). What should I do? Thank you! "

7397,"Left in The Dark - Very little to no communication regarding on-going treatment, access to therapy and medication, even in a mental health crisis. Going through an extreme manic phase due to my Bipolar, feel completely left in the dark. Always promised a follow up or phone call that never happens. Been very close on several occasions asking for a withdrawal from all GMMH services, my condition has ruined me, both socially and employment wise and I feel invisible to everyone including the service, despite really good people working there. Got huge respect for people in GMMH and my experience has been positive with most of the people that I have worked with. However, I feel like a number on a list to the service, only been contacted when I end up in hospital. Absolutely huge disparities in quality of support between South Manchester and North Manchester. Feels like resources, both in quality and quantity are concentrated in South Manchester whilst you are even lucky to get through to speak to someone in the North. "
7199,Cardiology - Wonderful attentive care despite the current situation. - My mother was admitted towards the end of September with acute heart failure symptoms. The care she received was second to none and she has made a quite frankly miraculous recovery. The current Covid-19 situation has made everyone's lives far more complicated but this did not stop the quality of care being the highest standard possible. All of the staff have been very supportive of us as a family and nothing has been too much bother. My mother is leaving hospital today to go to respite care having spent a little over 6 weeks in the ACU. She is leaving as a different person for which we are truly grateful. I will be writing to the staff on the ward to reiterate this review to them. Sincerely and gratefully. Mr W. T. 
1994,"This hospital is amazing I went it since I was coughing up blood staff was nice, understanding and very caring . I got a free meal of my choice a ice Lolly and refillable drinks and a word shearch . While I waited they took me to a room and let me wait on the bed and eat while they had a look at my x-ray . The hospital was clean and I didn't experience one thing apart from the WiFi but it's the same in every hospital. I know it can be a bit of a long wait but there are a lot of people who all need to be treated to and you obviously have a word shearch, dot to dot for free to entertain you . I am so thankful and don't understand why this place only has 3.2‚≠êÔ∏ès 100 percent recommended"
2062,Friendly and punctual
3465,The staff have been incredibly supportive (Fern Centre) - At a time of my life when I was great grief at the sudden death of my husband and the diagnosis of malignant melanoma I was very low. Anxiety about the future affected my life. I was anxious about attending the Fern Centre. I was welcomed so warmly that my anxious thoughts soon disappeared. All my contact - by phone or face to face - has been amazing. The staff have been incredibly supportive. I have been blessed to have been given 3 reiki sessions. I leave after each session feeling good and in control. I am able to use visualisation at home to transport me back to the room where I can once again experience the warmth and comfort.
6809,good place to park if visiting the hospital
82,All staff very attentive upbeat and helpful. Food very good varied and still hot when it got to Eashing ward. Very impressed with physio S Stephens and colleague by getting 81 year old who hadnt moved realy for 2 days to wake up and walk up the Ward and back.
4228,nothing it was amazing the staff was amazing the doctors will really good thank you for my amazing stay
5071,"I hate to knock down the service which helps keep people alive. But I went to A&E as advised by 111 with a suspected infection as it was too late for my doctors and my neck was swelling. I has my temperature taken by the triage team and it showed a high temp and a high heart rate. Knowing full well I have an infection of some sorts, I was seen eventually by a man in blue uniform (don't think he was a doctor) and put my jaw pain and swelling to TMJ. I knew I had an infection but I just wanted to get out after waiting 2 hours for him to go back and forth with W doctor about what it may be. The next day my glands got more swollen. I had to call doctors and dentists and eventually got seen to be Shropdoc in Ludlow to be told I have an extreme infection and immediately got put onto antibiotics. If i would have believe the person who told me it was TMJ, I could have had further complications due to him not bothering to check my temp or heart rate. I had wasted money on painkillers instead of antibiotics and cocodamol which I was eventually given. He even showed me on google on his phone what he thought I had. When two other doctors took one look at me in Ludlow and immediately knew what I had. This isn't the first time PRH A&E have misdiagnosed an infection either. I know covid is bad, but so can an infection which can lead to sepsis. I showed symptoms of that and wasn't even cared for! "
2200,"The staff were excellent but the waiting area was swarmed with flies, we were asked after an hour if we wanted to move but therere were only 2 people ahead of me at that stage. Once again the staff that I came into contact with were excellent."

1715,"I have just spent 4 days on C3 and D2 with my son who was brought into resus as an emergency. We received the highest care from all of the staff. Sadly our Addenbrooke's journey is just beginning, but I'm sure our outpatient experience will be just as amazing as our inpatient experience."

5606,"Don't know - CT Scanning Results - Had a CT Scan 3 weeks ago and no results or update from the department yet. Chased numerous times via switchboard and the answering machine states machine full try later.

8369,"Cardiology - Wonderful in all areas - This comes with a big thank you to the ambulance services, AandE, AAU and Ward 1 for the care and support you gave to my mother before and during her stay at Airedale. During these difficult times we appreciated working is much harder for key workers. At no point did my mother or I feel unsafe or vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus. The staff showed as much calm, care, compassion and support as I am sure they would have done during normal circumstances. We as a family feel we are lucky to live in the vicinity of this wonderful hospital. Thank you so much Airedale Hospital and all its staff üôèüå∏ "

8524,"Reception at women's health desk for ultrasound appts at this hospital on July 30 lunchtime was rude, even if you are asking kindly she would just talk and stare at you condescendingly. I also work in the Trust (but of course did not reveal it as I thought of myself as a patient and be treated equally as others) and do my job dutifully and I do not think I deserved being treated that way by reception staff."

3840,"Gastrointestinal and Liver services - Great staff - All doctors and nurses in the Gastroenterology Department are extremely helpful and caring. They go out of their way to try to help us to get better. Although the department is extremely busy & often overbooked, I've been given same day or next day emergency appointments when I'm very ill. I'm ever so grateful to all the doctors. I'm so lucky that I'm being looked after so well. Ealing Hospital is the best. Keep up the good work! "
2761,In n out very quick
3985,"'(Lamiroir was taken directly to the hospital. Ema ran around, barking orders, making phone calls. Trucy just clung to my arm and cried... And me, I was still in shock. Two bodies in two days is two too many.)'"
1630,"Imaging services - Attitude - I was informed x-ray will take 5 days to arrive at my GP practice. Fine. I have contacted my GP practice x-ray not arrived? Phone Witney Hospital, it was very clear the X-Ray assistant / Nurse? Who answered the phone, could be bothered. She extended the time an x-ray of arrival and was very blunt, and unprofessional. Making excuses is not the way to treat patience. We do have the right to find out results. I didn't realise it was such a big deal to ask a question. Not all are the same. Others are helpful, it was unfortunate I had one who just fobbed me off and thought I would not notice. She could have easy checked to see if my results had been forwarded. Instead turned around and said computers are down? It appeared to be an afterthought. Not professional. Why couldn't she have said at present system down, I will check for you later etc. Instead told me to ask my GP to phone them to chase up results? Waste of a phone call, waste of GP's time. Just because she could'nt be bothered. She has let the NHS down"
890,"Despite the virus I was able to get my kidney tube replaced at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital. It's not a pleasant experience to say the least but the kindness of ALL the NHS staff makes it much easier. A smile, holding of the hand, a little joke means everything. üíïüíï xx"
887,"Breast cancer services - Fantastic Staff a credit to the NHS - I visited this department on the 7th January for breast surgery. I would like to thank all of the fantastic staff for there care and for putting me at ease. I had to return to the department on the 12th as I had been let down by the community care. I was seen to immediately without fuss by the ward sister, who immediately put me at ease. All the staff here work extremely hard and are so caring and patient, they are a credit to the hospital and I would like to extend my sincere thanks. "
5608,My visit was stress free and everything was good thank you
6861,I was dealt with very quickly. The staff were all friendly and efficient. | Nothing it was all very good
7599,Accident and emergency services - Unacceptable practice - My mother was taken to the cdu on 6.1. 2020 by ambulance after having a funny turn. She was left along with lots of other patients in corridors on a trolley bed for 18 hours. We accept there was a shortage of beds but nobody offered my mom a drink or anything to eat during all these hours and this we find totally unacceptable. Also nobody kept us informed of what was happening at all. There seemed to be a total lack of communication. Also when she actually moved into a proper ward she had not even been given her usual medications which were strong pain relief and anxiety tablets although we had said that she needs them. This is also unacceptable. We were told that the staff could not administer them as they had not been prescribed by the hospital. This is so wrong as our mom was in severe pain and very anxious and really needed her medication. This was eventually sorted out but why should she have had to suffer the pain and anxiety for so long I even offered to administer them myself but was told I couldn't. Just seems so wrong to let someone suffer so much when there was no need. The medication was prescribed by our moms own gp after all. Just seems so senseless.
6395,I arrived at the hospital way before my appointment as didnt want to be late due to traffic etc. I booked in and got comfortable as I thought I was in for a long wait. Next thing I know my name was called out. I was taken to meet my surgeon for follow up appointment after surgery. All in all very impressed with how it all went.
282,"Answer the bloody phone, get your act together"

9533,"SDEC at Barnstaple Hospital - I was referred to Barnstaple Hospital with a suspected Cardiac problem. My partner dropped me off at ED at 14:00, by 19:30 I was all finished. Triage in ED, taken along to SDEC (Same Day Emergency Care), various bloods, ECG, examinations, all the staff were absolutely wonderful and knowledgeable. I can only praise them for the 1st Class Care I was given."
1479,"Major trauma - Brilliant loved the staff on A&E and on the Thrusal Ward - The Nurses, Doctors and Consultants were just brilliant I couldn't ask for anything more from the hospital at such a busy night / day"
7801,"Gallbladder operation yesterday. The staff on ward 18 were absolutely amazing couldn't do enough for you, very helpful explain every procedure and very friendly you are all a credit to the nhs from nurses to surgeons thank you all."
3276,"Outstanding primary care centre - My wife and I have today received the covid vaccine, and we would like to place on record, that the experience, could not have been faulted. The organisation was excellent. We were dealt with by a very efficient, professional, and extremely well versed staff, in a well laid out care centre. Many thanks, Robert and Marjorie Thornton"
7246,"Unaware night team - While I cannot fault the day team of nurses and medical assistants I cannot say the same about the night team. This certainly isn't a review of their medical capability, far from it, it is more a criticism of their overall awareness on the ward. I recently had a relatively short stay on the Samaritan Ward at Guy's Hospital and while I find it hard to sleep on a ward at the best of times it was made extra difficult on Samaritan purely by the fact that the harsh fluorescent light are kept on up until 1:30am despite the official time saying lights are dimmed at 10pm and are turned off by 11pm. When asked to turn the lights off the staff just shrug and carry out there duties and would eventually turn out the light closed to my ward bed, which ultimately defeats the point. The ward also has signs up on the wall saying restful sleep helps us to get better which becomes an ironic slap to the face after a certain hour. To add to this, various machines are often left sounding their alarm for some time without anyone coming to attend them which also doesn't create the most conducive environment for restful sleep"
9017,
8967,"Don't know - Disappointed & in pain - I am really disappointed with A&E Receptionist, I came to the hospital after being involved in a motorbike accident, unable to move my thumb, with a bruise bigger then my hand on my knee, I explained the situation and explained I suffer with severe anxiety and wouldn't be able to sit alone, they told me it's the only option and then watched me leave in tears having an anxiety attack, they refused to make any sort of exception despite my borderline personality disorder, depression and anxiety which means I'm going home in agony and distress without the treatment I require. "
1517,"Vascular surgery - Complete Service - On Tue 11th August I experienced loss of feeling in my right leg. Within 20 minutes of calling 111, an ambulance arrived and I received initial care. I was then blue lighted to FPH. Within a couple of hours, I was scanned and admitted to F2 and operated on the following day. The care I received throughout this traumatic time was outstanding and I cannot give enough praise to the team (night and day) Their care and dedication was exemplary. Thank you, thank you, thank you NHS for saving my life. I will forever be in your debt. "
8153,"This hospital is a joke. Never trust again, they wrongly 2018 diagnosed my stepdad with lump nods cancer, which turned out to be cancer everywhere, died in 3months. Now they hav had my partner in hospital 2021 23rd July. 24 hours they still not got her highly addictive meds, leaving her in a mess."
9752,"Honest review of CAMHS - Please don't censor me. This is for the goodness of CAMHS and to hopefully provide areas of improvement to look into. I have already gone through PALS about this, and deciding to make this a review. Positive and negative reviews should be published, otherwise it isn't a fair balance. I feel some professionals at CAMHS needs to improve on their ability to compromise with their patient's family. Family are around their children 24/7 and know what they're struggling from, so they may have a good idea on what treatment may benefit their child based on their unique emotional needs. I feel some professionals at CAMHS spends far too much time working through the textbooks, instead of seeing their patients as individuals. One size never fits all, when it comes to mental health. It may work this way for physical ailments, but CAMHS needs to look into that person's environment, how their environment affects them, and recognise that depression / anxiety can be symptoms of a main issue. Not always chemical imbalance. This is what would've helped me, when those who worked with me at CAMHS failed to recognise my childhood trauma while under their services. I was under their service from 2012, and not once was my C-PTSD picked up on. I feel some professionals at CAMHS needs to stop dishing out medication, and allow patients the choice between medication or therapy. Whereas a patient like me didn't have a choice, and was instead given the impression that medication was the only thing that could cure me. I would've benefitted more from specialised trauma therapy, instead of being medicated. 4 years I was under their service, and even now I'm still scared of leaving the house, have no proper independence, deal with flashbacks and intense dissociation - which means the professionals I was under at CAMHS didn't do what they should have done, help. I feel some professionals at CAMHS needs to allow patients to explore diagnosis and rule them out. Just because a child hasn't finished growing, doesn't mean they can't have PTSD or schizophrenia. It would be good to explore diagnosis, instead of deny that your child is struggling. This way, once ruled out, CAMHS and yourself can move forwards. I feel in general CAMHS needs to understand autism better, as some issues such as eating disorders can be related to sensory issues in autism. I feel some professionals at CAMHS needs to realise that children don't just grow out of mental illness, and can turn into mentally ill adults which require more support. I feel some professionals at CAMHS needs to understand that CBT and breathing exercises can't magically cure mental illness, either. And to allow patients to express when some treatments don't provide any benefit. Complex mental health needs must be better understood."
4379,Everything was excellent. Nursing staff kind and professional. Even brought me breakfast. Doctor saw me really quickly and got me into a scan very quickly.
5380,"Accident and emergency services - Uncomfortable seats in A & E waiting area - Went in with painful hip and came out with additional complaint of painful coccyx through sitting on poor chairs waiting 3 hours to see a doctor. Some people waiting longer (6 hours) also remarked how hard the seats were after such lengthy periods seated. Chairs are basically good, short term, but the base of the seat rises towards the back causing most upper body weight to be taken at the base of spine (Coccyx). I suggest the front legs of chairs be propped up an inch or so to enable the weight to be shared more fully by buttocks / upper thighs. It has taken me about a week to recover from the pain in the base of my spine. DMH please look into this very simple but very important problem. Thank you. "

Everyone was really caring and supportive and helpful as I had swallowed some steak that had got stuck in my food tract. I would like to thank the nurse and the doctor who provided me with a fizzy drink which greatly alleviated my discomfort - so much so that I could come through before I was put on a drip.

2798,Inpatient mental health services - Disappointed - I put a complaint to CQC oh yes they did an investigation done by a member of staff from The Harplands complete cover up staff members who told me report to CQC which I had never heard of completely denied everything. I honestly dont know how they live with themselves.I would never go back and anyone thinking of going or taking someone think twice.The staff when you go in are brilliant really worked hard to help me.The trouble starts once you agree to be admitted I dont know about the other wards I only know about wards 3 and 7 disgraceful

5527,"Excellent patient care - My husband was in main ITU for a couple of weeks. Just looking at him via facetime, I could definitely say that he is being looked after well. The nurses were very kind and accommodating to the family's request and made things easier for us. They do their work with compassion. Doctors were very patient to answer our queries and took time to call us and give daily updates. This really helped ease our anxiety. I understand how busy ITU is and the pressure is overwhelming and that is why I salute all of them for rising above the challenges, and for not losing touch of the essence of their vocation...I am most grateful for their dedication and their hard work. They did not go unnoticed. Thank you so much."
1780,Ophthalmology - Cataract - Had small cataract for several months. I know cataract removal can restore temporary loss depending on how long it's been there.I use a wheelchair been seen by ophthalmologist when consultant neurosurgeon thought I had shunt problem. Waiting times are as bad as they were for kidney sone surgery which was postponed 3 times. I don't care about the pandemic.If thishapebd before the pandemic it makes me feel like you have no tie for people with other needs. I have epilepsy and hope it's done as outpatient appointment. I hated the time on the urology wards.Nurses didn't care.Although nurses at night did. You can't leave a patient over 6 days with an unchanged urostomy bag and flange just because they would not do it.Please don't keep me in hospital I don't care about covid or the epilepsy! 
6486,"Accident and emergency services - Excellent - Visited A&e, had a subsequent mri, all done efficiently and kindly. Given the current pressures I'm extra grateful as how smoothly everything went.

Clinicians all professional and am also impressed by the administration staff working quietly in the background who made the process smooth.

Unfortunately the Dr we saw was quite abrupt asking what made us come to visit the clinic and we were made to feel like time wasters. No parent should be put off seeking medical advice. 
2978,"Firstly I went to A&E recently and it was quick and efficient, I had no issues with the service. The one star is for the communications which is non existent. My father was admitted, caught covid on a ward (ward 11), got transferred to a covid ward (ward 29). The nurses were very helpful in establishing contact via an iPad i had sent in. The ward had a mobile phone which was pointless because no one answers the phone and they were using mobile data and not hospital wifi when using watsap- which genius decided this was a good idea? it was giff gaff mobile data aswell - you simply can't make this stuff up. The issue is they don't bother keeping relatives informed and updated, constantly having to phone and they don't answer or it is engaged - so much effort and energy is expended just trying to get an update on how your loved one is doing. It truly is unacceptable putting relatives through undue stress and anguish. I appreciate they are busy but surely it's not beyond their gift to sort out communications especially at a time when visitors are not allowed. it beggars belief that an effective communications strategy is not in place 10 months on since the start of the pandemic."

5405,"Obstetrics And Gynaecology - Fantastic friendly staff - I was sent to the Early Pregnancy Unit late one evening and because I wasn't an emergency I had to wait for the doctors from labour ward to come and see me. The nurse who was in the Early Pregnancy Unit called the car parking people for me so that I wasn't fined for my ticket expiring and she lent me a phone charger as, being non urgent and with it being late in the evening, I had a long wait. She kept me informed as to where things were at in terms of how busy the doctors were. I felt so welcome and well looked after and like asking for things like where I could get water or to sort my parkung out was no trouble. I'm so pleased I have chosen Darlington to have my baby. "

4744,Ophthalmology - Bad communica - My husband attends eye clinic for macular degeneration and glaucoma. He has an appt for 2 sept 2020 for telephone consultation and has had several texts telling him not to come to hospital - today he has received a text saying attend anywhere which is a very obscure message. We can never get thru to the admin who handle the apptments because phones are never answered or go straight to a / phone. An hour of trying and having to go thru switchboard several times because lines to clinics cut off when not answered I finally got thru to the clinic itself and they didn't know what the message meant either but confirmed that the consultant would be phoning us. A complete waste of my time and the time of the overworked staff at PAH trying to keep a broken system working

8822,Recently i had very bad problems with the big toe joint it had swollen up and was very painful i had a job walking it may have been started by a puncture wound. I phoned up and saw the nurse for a check on the wound all in order. Unfortunately it did not get any better and i spoke to the Doctor who prescribed medicines as they thought appropriate at the time. Eventually i did see the Doctor for a consultation which was thorough and it was arranged for a blood test to see if i had gout or something else. The blood test came back and as a result of some queries i had a Doctor phoned me back to explain and alleviate my concerns . So in conclusion in my mind we are so lucky and i am grateful for a first class service. Receptionists are always polite and helpful as are the Doctors Many Thanks Again.

6121,"Absolutely disgusted with the service myself and my 5 month old daughter received today at the urgent care centre in erith. After queuing outside in the cold for an hour with my baby she then needed her feed, I went to the front of the queue asked if I could go inside To feed my baby and then I would return to my place in the queue (not queue jumping or asking to be priority) I was told no ‚Äúthere is a bench outside‚Äù I explained it was too cold to feed outside and was then ask...ed do I mean ‚Äúbreastfeed‚Äù- not that this is any of their business, I said no I already had a bottle prepared and just needed a warm space to do this and was then told this wasn't possible as this is not what they do and needed to wait in the queue. The door was open so I went in and was met by the ‚Äúmanager‚Äù who told me there were too many people in there, I explained again my baby needed feeding and If I were to breast feed her I'm sure I would be offered a warm and private place. The manager agreed, I then said there is absolutely no difference and explained to her that she had to allow me to feed my baby, she then replied to me with ‚Äúno I don't have to offer you anywhere at all‚Äù I disagreed and said it's absolutely disgusting, she turned around and asked ‚Äúwhat is? ‚Äù I replied the way you are treating my baby and she then replied ‚Äúif you carry on with the attitude we won't see you at all‚Äù. So my poorly baby who was waiting outside for an hour already because she bad chest was going to be denied being seen by a ‚Äúmanger‚Äù all because she needing feeding and her mum stood her ground for this. I explained to the ‚Äúmanager‚Äù that I was shocked she has a managers position as she couldn't even cater for me to allow me to feed my baby. I'm shocked and completely disgusted by the staff at erith urgent care centre, i completely understand that the nhs is over run and extremely busy but no parent or carer should ever feel like they need to plead to feed and meet their babies needs.

Was laughed at by a doctor, sat in a chair for 3 hours, and told to get a medicine which the doctor even wrote on a piece of paper which than turned out to be impossible to get as I need a prescription for it which I didn't have. Also, was told to be taking it for 7 days which later turned out that this and even weaker medicine than this cannot be taken for longer than 3 days. Very incompetent doctors.

6206,"Geriatric Medicine - Communication severely lacking - My mum is currently an in-patient. A&E were very good updating me. Whilst i really do know we are in very strange times and the staff wok very hard, we cannot visit etc, communication is very bad when we need it more than ever. Mum has dementia, she wants to see us (we know that is not possible) she's been prevented from speaking with us as the patient phone has not been working in the ward. The staff firstly said to me they would not tell me anything over the phone, after a lot of perseverance they did the first day. They are very reluctant to disclose anything, my mum is going down hill mentally today i tried to speak with her as phone working again, she is closing down and is a very vulnerable, this in turn is effecting her physical health. The drs and physio don't return calls even though i have left messages saying how worried i am. I have power of attorney for her health which they know and would like to discuss her health, but unable too. I fear without communication she will give up. So sad that communication is so lacking, having used the hospital in the past and found them to be very good, although even then communication was not brilliant. "

1221,"No longer fit for purpose! Balderton Primary care centre, Lowfield Lane, Balderton, Newark. - My experience of this so called Doctors surgery relates in the main to my wife. It is evident now that what was once a very nice surgery is no longer fit for purpose! Huge long phone queues to contact them are the norm, whilst awaiting my flu jab there recently a young lady came to the reception desk with her mobile phone and stated she had been in the queue for two hours and with her phone still on the line to the surgery stated she was still number two in the queue, she resorted to a visit in the end! They are very adept since it was taken over at fobbing you off with a promise in 5 days time of an unqualified non doctor employee ringing you to see if in their non qualified opinion they will refer a patient to a doctor, but of course they never ring you 5 days later! It cannot have failed to have escaped your attention either, the extremely serious recent bad publicity this surgery has accrued, or indeed the feelings of their patients who are becoming quite rightly very vociferous in their condemnation of this surgery! As an example if you remain unconvinced, check out Google reviews on this establishment to see the opinions of patients. What was a good surgery has been taken over by a company that seem only interested in profits, getting to see a doctor is almost impossible and they are a classic example of why our fine doctors, nurses, and staff in our hospitals are overrun with patients turning up at the A&E departments because the GP's are not doing their job as they should do, comfortable in the knowledge that they still get their salaries! The situation, I humbly submit, needs a review, and a rapid sort out, before it costs someone their life due to the inaction of what is laughably known as Primary Care! "

6759,"Sent home with no answers - I know A&E is extremely busy and wouldn't be there if it was thought necessary. The first people I came into contact with which was the person booking in, the staff member who did the obs and the nurse who triaged - all were so lovely and helpful. I knew there was an extremely long wait but I had a bit of oramorph so it made me sleepy and I was quite happy to people watch to pass the time. Eventually after about 4 hours or so of waiting I was called in by a staff member who seemed not to like that I asked for help with walking there. I walk with crutches as have mobility problems and was in there because my hand and arm went numb and I was in awful pain. I couldn't use my crutch in my right arm as the pressure was making more pain and I use the crutches for balance. I went into a room with this person who never even introduced themself so didn't know what their role was. The first thing that was said to me after asking what the problem was to ask what I want them to do about it. I said I wanted to find out why I'm in so much pain, why I can't feel my fingers, why my hand keeps swelling up and going cold and all I got was it's not an A&E problem it's a GP and physio problem and was to speak to them, which I have been with the physio, but can't get to speak to my GP for a few weeks. I then asked how I can manage with not being able to walk as I need to use both crutches and they said I needed to wait till my physio appointment. That's ok as my physio has been the best help I've had. But seeing as though I wouldn't be seeing them for 4 days, I asked how I can get about as it is a long time. I was just directed to the exit. I said I knew where it was I just would like some help to get there and they turned round and just the door. I stood there crying as I couldn't walk and I was just left with no way of getting to the entrance. A nurse saw me and asked what was wrong and I asked to speak to someone senior as being disabled is hard enough but when you have another problem that impedes your ability to move and get anywhere is even tougher. They eventually after some arguing took me in a wheelchair to the entrance so my mum could fetch me. I have never been treated like that before. I know they are busy but treatment should never be slack because of this. I felt like this staff member wasn't interested and couldn't care less and I got the same impression from body language too. Surely If someone presents with no feeling in their fingers and a swollen and cold hand and lots of pain some sort of investigation should be done not sent home to wait for weeks for a GP to refer you somewhere. This is wrong especially when someone has a complex medical history and spinal problems as it is. This staff member could do to improve bedside manners and at least try to put a patient's mind at rest not make them upset and feel even worse, with no answers."
7172,"Minor injuries unit - A shortsighted practice - I came with a fingertip injury which bleeded heavily and took 12 hours to form a scab but we couldnt get there earlier as it had happened on a weekend. I was said I will only see a nurse as it is minor, then said I have to clean the wound with water / I just broke at that point and refused to go through the bleeding again. To explain-nhs / red cross advice says do not wet / do not disturb the scab, leave to heal on its own if its a clean cut. Not happy I wasnt even asked what had happenedSAD no dressing which I asked for-just left with a ‚ÄòThank you'."

7130,"Cancer treatment - I understand that we are in difficult times. I live in Lincoln and am currently having to travel to Grantham for my cancer treatment because of the Covid situation. I appreciate that Lincoln hospital is not an option but would have thought it was easier for myself who is having non-intravenous treatment to be treated at home. I have an hours travel for my stats and bloods to be taken, which could be done at my GP surgery, as they were this week, and then have a quick injection. I also say that because the majority of nurses there usually work in Lincoln also have to travel, on top of working a 10 hour shift. Surely a dedicated team of 2 or 3 nurses based around Lincoln could see patients such as myself. As treatment progresses travel will become more uncomfortable. "

And you can just tell that shes properly in it for her patients, not money or status she is just a warm hearted person who has each night stayed and talked with me while i cant sleep at silly o'clock in the morning and when she comes in for her shift she waves. And i feel like its a lot better being looked after by someone who seems genuinely concerned for you're wellbeing! "

Was very caring and felt Doctor was very sincere. Absolutely first class service. Proud to live in a country with premiere heath care. Well done NHS. Many Thanks to all at Heartlands A & E."
415,All staff were extremely attentive and friendly private healthcare on the NHS.
875,The Technician I sore was very pleasant and explained everything that he was checking. He gave me a clean bill of health and that everything was working well.He also said that I could start driving again although he said that I would not get a letter to confirm his findings. This presents a problem with the DVLA who require written confirmation of his findings. Rolf James
6391,Mrs Helen Soothill whom I Saw at MSK gave me the most highly professional and excellent service and care. This has helped me to move forWard with greater confidence
4765,Nothing. The staff have been amazing. I could see that they where short staffed due to a virus going around but they never let any stress show anything. Thank you

6112,The virtual visiting is great it's relived any anxiety I've had about my admission to hospital as I know I'll get my daily phone call [5es][5isfc]
1955,Testing for covid - I was able to book a covid test the same day for my daughter which was positive.(I think she is going to be ok). This made it possible for us to self isolate straight away hopefully it has kept the infection rate down and might have saved lives I know all the staff at the Medway hospital are working so hard and my heart goes out to them. My wife and I have decided this year to keep Christmas celebrations to our family bubble and keep travel and contact to a minimum which I am sure alot of other people will be doing ( It's a trade off) Hopefully the hospital staff will get a break this Christmas just wanted you to know there are people who really appreciate what you are doing. Sorry if the wording is not quite right I am not very good with grammar.

8829,"Accident and emergency services - AWFUL!!! - came to A&E in severe pain. They give you a mask but when some people sit down they just pull them down A person came in complaining of a previous lung infection (you can hear because they triage you in front of everyone unless you ask them not to) then went on to say she had a temperature and her doctor told her to come to A&E at which point they made her sit down with her temperature in the waiting room with everyone else!!!! I was triaged by a first nurse then triaged again by a second nurse, was told I was being sent to gynaecology but instead was sent to Urgent Care and triaged by a nurse pracrioner - at no point was I examined bar a temperature check and blood pressure test in A&E initially . Urgent Care is an awful tiny dingy grubby looking department with no windows - seriously depressing! Eventually I was told go back to doctors and ask them to send you back to us before being sent home."

6927,"Care services for end of life care - Excellent Care - Torbay hospital staff could not have looked after our 97 year old father (with dementia) during his 7 day stay with them. Once it was clear he would not recover, the staff were exemplary in treating him with respect, care and dignity. He was on a ward initially until it was clear he wasn't recovering and then moved to a side room where we could spend as much time as we liked with him during his final days. You could not have had a better room if it had been private. No other visitors were allowed as this was in the Time of Covid, but we felt very safe at all times. Several staff members popped in to see him who had been working for a care company previously and had visited him and our mother at home over the years. At no time did he appear to be in pain, and if we said to staff that he seemed restless, they responded quickly. We are forever grateful for making our memories of our father's last days as good as they could have been."
4341,"25/08/21 I came in with my sister the staff were lovely, Dom our midwife took the time to really get to know us and was kind and understand. I'm very thankful for the staff who made a very long night much easier - well worth it in the end though üòäüòä"

Private consultant did not show for 2 days, so cancelled him as he could not even be bothered to phone to cancel.!!!! She was ment be sent home by ambulance. Then phoned for me to pick her up. Took over an hour to find a wheelchair! Discracefull! "
40,"No help and no recovery - Awful awful awful place that I'm trying to recover from!!!! . was sectioned to keats ward and it was the worst time of my life. staff too busy to help with pretty much anything because there isn't enough of them, having to ask 2 or 3 times for help or medication and then giving up when you're still ignored. Its just not good enough when you're in a bad place and believe your surroundings will make you better. most of the nurses are rude, cold and aloof. ask for their help and they will show you how much you've put them out!! unclean ward, very noisy constant alarms going off all hours, no chance whatsoever of respite or recovery. it beggars belief how this place is even considered a place of help. unfortunately I can't help that I'm mentally ill, but I do hope I have a say in never returning to this disgusting place again. Nothing positive to say at all about Keats Meadowbrook. it's scary how poorly vulnerable women are sent here at their mercy. it will take me time to recover from this place properly with the help of cmht.

663,"Ear, Nose & Throat - Excellent experience with ENT at Charing Cross - A few weeks ago I underwent a Branchial cleft cyst removal and tonsillectomy at Charing Cross Hospital. I stayed in the hospital for several days and every single healthcare professional that cared for me during my stay was wonderful and made me feel so safe and comfortable. My surgeons were so knowledgable, reassuring, kind and answered all my questions ensuring that I was fully informed and comfortable at every step. My lovely anesthesiologist also really helped to calm my anxiety before the surgery and was very thorough and prepared in his preop safety assessment. All the nurses, both in the recovery ward and the ward I stayed in after were so kind, professional and caring. Despite the COVID circumstances and enormous pressure on healthcare staff at the moment, they all consistently made me feel taken care of and ensured I was having the best possible recovery after my surgery. I am now two weeks post op and feel great. Thanks to my skilled surgeons and the excellent post-op care provided by the ENT team and ward nurses, I had no complications and am practically back to normal - just cyst free! Thank you so much! "

7839,"horrendous waiting time over 8 hours before I arrived at Thursday at 10pm, Dr where good once seen"
5692,"Wonderful Experience - I wanted to write to you to tell you about the fantastic patient journey we experienced at Macclesfield Hospital last Friday. I needed to bring my 83 year old mother to have an injury assessed. I live in the area but my Mother lives near London and had been staying with me. We arrived in the main car park and I noticed the helpful signs about registering my mother's disabled blue badge. The staff at the information point, some of whom were volunteers, couldn't have been more helpful. The lady who registered the badge explained the system clearly and another volunteer offered to escort us to A and E. Once we moved the car to the A and E car park we were able to park easily in the disabled spots. We walked into the department and found chairs next to the Reception window which was really helpful. The lady who took our details was efficient but incredibly kind and thoughtful. I particularly noticed that she lowered her voice to ask ‚Äúwidow? ‚Äù. My Mother had recently been widowed after 62 years and is still coming to terms with her loss. The Receptionist couldn't have know but the fact that she asked the question so sensitivity really resonated with me. The Receptionist even took the time to ask if my Mother would like a wheelchair and then went to get one and sanitise it for us. The level of care and professionalism was incredible. We were then triaged in the office next to the waiting room. Again the nurse was professional, caring and informative. I was grateful that I was allowed to advocate for my Mother. The triage nurse asked my mother questions directly and listened to her answers rather than assuming I would speak for her. I was impressed that even though I was there to support, the patient was my Mother and she was the focus. We waited and a nurse came to take us to the GP out of hours service. Again I was so impressed that we were collected and taken to the right place. At no time did we feel lost or just a part of a system. We felt that we were individuals that mattered. Having waited again a Doctor invited us into her consulting room and again we had a professional experience. The Doctor listened to my Mother, asked appropriate questions, reassured her and was honest in her diagnosis. She explained what might have happened, what to do to improve the situation and what to look out for that would be a cause for concern in the future. I couldn't praise your staff and volunteers enough. They were kind, professional, efficient and knowledgeable. Please pass on my thanks and gratitude "

5417,"I wanted to know what was happening - Rang 111 service due to bleeding / clotting at nearly 11 weeks pregnant, was advised to visit A&E within the hour. 5-6 hours in A&E while under impression I would receive an ultrasound. Was then seen on Pilgrim hospital gynaecology ward & had a speculum examination. Nurse advised I needed to stay over night to be monitored (despite me expressing I did not want to stay, my obs were fine & I felt fine in myself) nurse advised I would receive emergency ultrasound the next day so I agreed to stay, as I was desperate to know whether my baby had passed away. Next day, I stayed on ward & still advised by staff I was waiting for on call doctor to arrive & perform ultrasound to give answers as to whether baby was still with us. At 1pm consultant did ward rounds and advised me I had been given incorrect information & would not be receiving an ultrasound as this is not a facility any department is able to provide during the weekend (4 staff attended while this information was given which I feel is perhaps insensitive & unnecessary) This news was completely devastating as I was desperate to know what was happening & found it traumatic being on a shared ward over night, no sleep or support from my husband which I could have had at home. The consultant also advised I was not guaranteed a scan the next day either, even if I stayed over night again or if I returned to the early pregnancy unit. I decided to return home to my family & to get some rest. Thankfully, I was given an ultrasound appointment in the early pregnancy unit the next day and unfortunately my baby had passed away & I was offered the different treatment options available. The midwife who spoke with us immediately after the devastating news was simply amazing, compassionate & genuine. Explained our options clearly & genuinely seemed to care that we were going through such a harrowing experience. We can't thank this midwife enough for her care & compassion and felt it made a traumatic experience a little bit more bearable. Clearly a very special person and midwife and should be recognised for this outstanding care. We are so very grateful & hope people can learn from the example."

Inside my temperature was taken with a thermometer under my tongue which had obviously been in many mouths before although hopefully sterilised. This was very worrying. Even hotels and hairdressers are using devices which do not actually have to touch a person to read their temperature. Reception and triage was very efficient. Doctor, when seen, had to seek consultant/ophthalmic advice re my eye condition. Detached retina/vitreous was suggested but by this time (5 oclock) the eye dept was closed and an emergency appt given f"

I was taken to hospital during the night. I am a disabled OAP - have ME which affects my mobility and life in every way - physical and mental stress have a detrimental affect. My sister managed to pick me up from hospital and run me home approximately 25 miles away. I have no complaints with the service provided as the staff are working under difficult conditions. Will have to try and avoid the circumstances that lead to my visit avernight. Thank you for sending me the feedback survey which I have difficulty finding on line. I am very much a novice with computers so hope this review will be adequate for your needs. Thank all the staff working at Royal Cornwall Hospital Truro.

Cleaners people bringing food / drinks health care assistants nurses sisters every one was amazing.

7632,"Urgent Treatment Centre - Rude and uncaring receptionist and eight hour wait - 111 sent me here late at night, saying I needed treatment within six hours. I arrived to find the most unhelpful receptionist I have ever encountered and an eight hour wait to be seen. I left untreated, with query shingles in the eye. I would like the unbelievably rude receptionist to receive training in how to deal with a patient who cannot hear what she is saying, behind her mask and Perspex screen. She was shaming, rude and arrogant. I left this hospital feeling totally uncared for. "

2614,"Don't know - Efficient and friendly service despite pandemic - I was recently sent to A&E by my GP. Once there I was quickly triaged by the nurse at the front desk (and was very grateful of the chair by her desk too), and was then immediately called to the second desk to check my details, before being sent through for second line nurse triage and bloods approx 10 min later. The second nurse did an excellent job of putting a cannula in first time even though I was very dehydrated (harder than it sounds). I was then moved to a cubicle in majors to wait to be reviewed by a doctor. One arrived surprising quickly and then wrote a treatment plan, and then a nurse set up my drips. Approx 2 hours or so later I was then well enough to try drinking some fluids and the doctor personally brought those over which was very kind of him, and eventually I was well enough to be discharged with a clear plan for what to do if the treatment stopped working. The outpatients pharmacy was also quick to dispense my prescription so I could leave the hospital, so I was able to be seen, treated and discharged within around 3 hours. All of the staff that I encountered from front desk to pharmacy were very friendly and while there may have been some waiting around, with A&E that is inevitable as they need to treat the most seriously unwell patients first. The nurse who took my bloods in minors also came back to check on me twice which was very kind of her. The only other point I would mention is that the staff had to keep paging security as there were several patients who were upset about not being able to smoke or vape in the hospital. However, I don't believe this is a pandemic specific situation and the staff dealt with it in a very calm and rational manner. With regards to the pandemic, that did not impact my treatment at all. COVID-19 infection controls were kept throughout my visit and I had to wear a mask which staff also wore (in addition to gloves and aprons). I was also tested for COVID 19 though I did not test positive. It was relatively quiet, and anyone concerned about visiting A&E if they are very unwell or sent by their GP should not be. Please note however that visitors are generally not permitted at the moment, so if someone accompanies you they are unlikely to be able to go with you beyond the front desk."
3027,"7 months since my accident, I was finally discharged to my GP by my consultant at Wexham Park Hospital. Can I just say a huge thanks to all the wonderful staff at @FrimleyHealth Wexham Park. Without exception, they all personified what our wonderful #NHS stand for. Thank you all! "

Information was accurate and communicated well, and appointments were quick to come through and easy to change when I needed to. The atmosphere was nice, it felt comfortable and friendly, and all staff were professional and thorough. I had my own small room and the surgery staff were friendly and skilled, and I was left feeling impressed with the quality of the hospital and grateful for the NHS, at a time when we know it is under such pressure.

9561,"Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery - Disappointing - I recently visited the Dermatology clinic for a biopsy which was confirmed as SCC skin cancer, the team in the Dermatology clinic are amazing. I was referred to the Maxillo Facial Clinic as the cancer needed a further operation. I had an appointment with one of the team who explained that I needed an operation urgently and would receive an appointment to see a consultant within the next week to discuss this. Two weeks later I had still heard nothing so decided it was best to call and check, I was informed that nothing had been booked and no appointment made. When you tell a patient that its urgent to have cancer removed but then dont follow up it just causes stress for that person. I feel really let down after my GP and the Dermatology team were so good and fast to react. The lady that answered my call just said she would talk to the secretary and hung up so I'm not even sure when this apparent urgent appointment will arrive. I'm so disappointed."

I Was In And Out In No Time Was Seen 20 Minutes Before My Appointment. There Was A Few Other Patients But The Room Had Air Con Which Was A Relief As It Was 26c Today. Was Given A Mask As You Walk In And Had To Wait 10 Minutes To Have My Temperature Checked, But Was Given A Seat Whilst I Waited. Really Fast Service. Normally Hospitals Have You Waiting Hours For Appointments. The Only Downside For Me Was Having To Spend 40 On Cabs, 20 Each Way As I Lived Out The Area. But It Needed To Be Done Lol"

Since then he had been moved 3 times, communication from ward (29) has been none existent unless we phone and even then its a different story and very time. No urine or stool samples taken no explanation as to why his potassium is low the list is endless on the one occasion a doctor did phone to ask my mum why he was confused she hadn't even realised he had dementia, Trust excuse 'probably a young doctor who had not read notes!'. Astounded by this excuse from PALS. I work for this Trust and I am ashamed of the standard of care and communication given to dementia patients and family, especially during this difficult period with no visitors allowed. Frankly horrified."

6145,The wait time was short and the X ray taken promptly. However the consultation with the Dr. was very poor. He gave no feedback as to the nature and extent of my break. Furthermore he was in favour of having my wrist pulled with pain relief. I was then party to his questioning where is the anaesthetic?Thankfully a nurse practitioner Lisa came to my rescue; on the grounds that the Dr. didnt really know how to carry out the procedure and she would show him how it was done. I had a lucky escape. She said that the pulling method was old fashioned and not good. This is unprofessional and unacceptabl
9007,

9747,"Maternity services - VERY poor aftercare - Very poor aftercare at Leicester general. Had my first baby there, the labour process midwives were amazing however I cant say the same for the post labour ward midwives. I discharged myself a day early due to the lack of support and guidance by the midwives. I had to fight to get discharged early as i wasnt receiving the support i should have been getting. Midwives were unattentive, rude and uninterested in helping me. They definitely made my first day as a new mother very hard, physically, mentally and emotionally. I will definitely not be going back to General for any pregnancies."

When I pointed out I had been in resus since 6am and I was also 8months pregnant she said she could take my number and call me when he wakes up. This was very distressing as it meant walking from the league of friends bungalow near a+e to acorn in the early hours of the morning alone and struggling.

No one told me that i need to go to a different hospital, no one even looked at us! Careless staff attitude, no sympathy for a child in pain! Im shocked and upset about Minor injuries Unit! "

The service that I experienced within the whole department was outstanding and I cannot praise the medical attention that I was given enough. All of those nurses and radiologists that I came in to contact with were, without doubt, some of the most caring medical staff that I have treated me throughout my medical problems. I am a 77 year old man with complete tears of my supraspintus tendons in both shoulders and, as such, I am in quite significant pain. All of those members of staff that I came in to contact with helped me to put up with the trauma of the situation. I would like to personally thank all of those involved in my investigation and wish them well throughout these troubling times and beyond. Good luck to all! "
5955,"Accident and emergency services - Awful experience - Was sent to A&E by my GP with a fairly serious brain bleed, the nursing staff at the coalface were brilliant, however following a quick examination by a doctor who questioned the GPs diagnosis bloods were taken, so all good so far. Then the 10 hour wait, no updates, no treatment or care, just lovely nursing making excuses for the doctors, when I threatened to leave a doctor from outside A&E magically appeared with the bloods results that had been completed hours before and agreed with the GPs diagnosis. All of this could have been done in 2 hours, and no the unit wasn't that busy and I sat watching doctors wandering about. The doctors must have been down the pub when the bedside manner and empathy tutorial was on at Uni, I love the NHS but some of them need reminding why they do the job. "

2511,All the medical services would rated Very Good.My experiences on the ward over 2 or 3 nights of a 6 night stay would be rated Very Poor - again the nursing staff were generally very good but the potential for disruption from single patients is very high. Its a reasonable estimate that I had no sleep for 3 nights!
9968,Respiratory Medicine - Excellent care - I was on ward 216 from 15th to 20th January the care was excellent and I came home understanding more about Asthma than I was aware the consultant I saw was excellent.
9995,Omg! The number of consultants and senior medical staff at @KingsCollegeNHS wandering round with their face masks only covering their mouths is shocking and disappointing too
866,"Receptionist Rude Rude Rude - Not only happened once but its has happen several times that few receptionist who works here is not only unhelpful but very rude. They don't know how to speak to patient on phone or when you walk in. Telephone manner is very very poor and rude. It looks and sounds like they have been dragged to work when they don't want to. Myself i work in Health care sector. In GP, receptionist are the first point of contact. People come to or call GP with their health problem. So, try to sound friendly, be polite, nice tone of voice. They are already in pain, stressed and when you speak rudely its more stressful for them. I have notice when we walk in to gp, few of them looks at you like you are the criminal, please greet them with smile. If you can't do all this than this might not be your job. Give it to someone who is way better than you. Smiling and being kind to others won't cost you anything. But doctor and nurse has always been very polite and friendly. "

Despite some apparent problems with computer systems and them having to do some stuff on clipboards to check people in, everyone working hard. Just brilliant. Not sure what would happen if these people weren`t volunteering to help. Very grateful. Daughter was treated very well and despite computer problems they checked her details carefully, as having jab for specific circumstances.

I was told I couldn't get my results over the phone, or text but an e mail may be possible. I offered to come in, but was told I couldn't because of Covid. I fully understand that the hospital is under pressure, but my results are sitting there, and all I am asking is to be told them .It won't take any time and will stop me worrying .I am now waiting for a new letter to be produced or potentially a call.

Once he had decided to go ahead with the long awaited operation I understood the need for me not to be able to visit. What I am not at all happy about is the problem I had in attempting to check on his welfare after the operation. Having been given a phone number for the ward I at least expected it to be answered when I phoned. Instead I had to wait for news of my husband when my daughter posted something on facebook later in the evening. My husband, although groggy, had sent her a text. I do not have a mobile phone so he could not send me one and he was in no fit state to talk on the phone. Today I have discovered that the ward my husband was in was closed whilst he was in surgery. No attempt made to contact me or to explain that to him later so he was unaware that I had no idea how he was. Even with Covid this is totally unacceptable. Would not want to use this place myself. "

She wouldn't give me the chance to ask her the questions I had and only after I challenged her, she decided to give me 5 minutes. Asking or not asking my questions though, would be the same because the reply was i don't know, you'll have to talk to your designated obstetrician.

4783,"My baby girl was born in Abbey Wing last Saturday and I cannot thank all nurses, midwifes, doctors and ward staff for their amazing approach and assistance throughout the whole process. I was induced on Friday and after night full of painful contractionsm baby was born the following morning. Midwifes were very friendly and sat with me all night assisting with anything I needed, they were very good at explaining stages of the process I was going through. Wonderful team, if you planning on delivering in St. Peter's then you are in a very safe and good hands! "

6293,Orthopaedics - Fantastic care - Got to say have never felt so looked after by caring helpful staff from entering to leaving the hospital all so very professional
3489,waiting time a bit long
6630,I saw an ENT consultant who spent most of the consultation telling me because I am old (in my 60s) that I shouldnt wear varifocal spectacles because I might fall.Made me feel very old and undervalued.He gave me results of a scan that I had in writing months ago and that was it.I asked him about using my hearing aids with phone and he gave me some information and told me to ask guys outside which I did and they didnt know.He had a female registrar with him which wasnt a problem only added to my discomfort about my old age and potential falls.I think it wasnt appropriate to discuss my spectacles and I
1664,"I was picked up by ambulance around midnight because I had taken a handful of sleeping tablets and didnt want to wake up (maybe ever?) My partner was scared and called 999. I have no memory at all of this but I hours later I vaguely remember two ladies talking to me about 4am and giving me leaflets. I was then told I could go and was left to WALK HOME alone at 4.30am - knowingly depressed, totally disorientated, couldnt figure out which road I was on etc. I was out of it and hugely vulnerable."
2346,Big thanks to the staff @UHNM_NHS at the Royal Stoke for their service last night when I brought my eldest up with a suspected broken arm. Great service from everyone we dealt with

6241,"Accident and emergency services - Very professional and reassuring practice. - I can't thank the doctor and nurses enough for their professionalism and concern. The doctor was very reassuring and immediately put in place the appropriate tests, which were administered really quickly. I felt I was in safe hands. Thank you."
6614,"Breast Surgery - Reassuring and efficient - I was referred to the pink rose suite after finding a lump in my breast. The staff were so reassuring and kind, and after examination I was given an ultrasound and my results within 10 minutes. They answered any questions I had and treated me with respect. "

764,"My mum was sent to A&E by her Dr suspect DVT. Doctor requested a scan, x-ray and blood test. 11 hours Later they hadn't done nothing.also I was asked to leave. By the look of the situation I had to stand outside with a group of other people who was also asked to leave. Good job I didn't because she would not have heard her name being called out several times. Staff are lovely the system is totally wrong. I understand that they don't won't A&E heaving with patients families, but they must be open to people who do need Somebody with them for Support."

5874,"Had been waiting for shoulder op for over a year due to covid when I got a call to see if I wanted to transfer to Ilkeston Community Hospital . I did and a few weeks later, today I have had my op. I didnt even know there was a hospital there. I have to say my experience today with ALL of the staff at the hospital from reception to the Trauma and Diagnostic ward where I was treated has been fantastic. In these trying times I could not have asked for a better service. I cannot remember all the names of the staff and it would be unfair to single anyone out in particular so I would just like to say a huge thank you to all of you Thank You Steve Walters"
3649,"A member of staff from Redwoods came to our hospital & made a complaint about myself. She came alone with a patient & was unable to manage her. she came to the desk & asked me to call the ward, i think it was Oakwood ward & get help to transport, I asked the patients name whereby she pulled her mask down & leaned over the screen & shouted at me I didnt understand, totally disregarding my safety. I explained that I needed the patients name to enable me to call. I then went into the back office & asked my colleague to call we have no phones on the front desk. She was exceptionally rude member of staff & obviously was not aware of protocol. Such a shame people like this are in the caring profession. Thankfully my colleague witnessed her appalling behaviour Lisa"
9515,"Maternity services - Incredible care - Absolutely blown away by the care we received during the birth of my daughter. Initially we were put off during triage admission as my husband was forced to stand outside in the cold whilst they assessed me alone. They were quite rude and unfriendly to him which was really off putting since he was stressed and felt very insignificant. However...once I was admitted everything changed and they were extremely welcoming and service was top. We had lovely birth centre delivery with good midwife and student support and then I ended up having to transfer to labour ward due to excessive bleeding. The midwives and doctors were all so respectful, reassuring and communicative. They explained what they were doing, took time to make sure I was ok and reassured me throughout my time in theatre. My husband who was left in the room with our newborn daughter was supported by the students so he didn't feel abandoned or in the unknown. The care and communication by the midwives and doctors is really what impressed me and it made all the difference. They were so friendly and calm during the emergency that I felt safe and looked after throughout. We were extremely happy with the care at Barnet and would highly recommend."
2572,Wait was quite long for a treatment that took less than 5 mins.
5965,"My appt was at 8:15; I arrived 5-10 mins early. I waited 1 and 1/2 hours to be called. No apology. The whole process took about 2 and 1/2 hours. Awful. How can you run so late so early in your day? However busy, you must be able to do better."
5655,"I have just watched my GD in her nativity play. Without the care and treatment given to me by @royalmarsdenNHS @royalmarsden #NHS I wouldn't be here. PLEASE, #vote to save our #healthservice and to #StopBrexit our #NHSNotForSale #VoteTactical #StopBoris"
1311,Excellent service and care and was dealt with very quickly with a good plan going forward.

3118,Waiting time for an emergency is unusual. if you are looking for an emergency because there is a need and because you leave people in this big wait.

3393,Excellent experience again for contraception lovely staff thanks for making it a safe and friendly environment
343,
3992,Friendly and well looked after
2469,Terrible and rude staff. Not explained anything not helpful and overall not giving you any confidence in what they are doing.
9998,"Waiting in a pretty full, albeit socially distanced waiting room for 1.5 hours after my appointment time to be seen is far too long. Either recruit more staff, or book fewer appointments - this is far safer and less stressful than waiting 1.5hours."
4382,"If you've got a couple of hours to spare you are at the right place. 20 patients in the waiting room and only one doctor. Terrible! After nearly 3 hours waiting my 5 years old daughter could not be seen by a doctor, obviously people living in brent have no where to go. If you can not cope close the place as simple as that."
6750,It was just a lack of communication at the beginning. The nurses had not got the information that I was coming in so were not prepared for me but then handled everything very well. They were excellent when I returned the heart monitor so full marks for that.
258,"I would give this hospital 0 stars if possible. After still feeling pain after morphine, the A&E Dr basically said I was making the pain up. I quote 'if you were really in as much pain as you say you are, you'd be bent doubled over unable to move'. I had explained previously that the pain was coming in waves and also the Dr was in the room with me for a grand total of maybe 10mins. Who is she to tell me I'm making the pain up?! She made me feel so unwelcome, embarrassed and gave me a complete lack of trust in the Dr from the off. Secondly, I am a T1 diabetic who hadn't eaten or drank anything since the day before. They wanted to keep me empty for the ultra sound but didn't tell me I could eat after until I was pretty much begging them. I was incredibly low on my blood sugar levels and thought I was going to have a huge hypo. Finally, they discharged me without removing my catheter. It wasn't till I was leaving that I noticed. I walked back to the ward and was ignored twice when I asked if someone could remove it. The nurse who did it seemed very annoyed at me for daring to ask. I have felt so let down by the NHS today. Turns out I have a blood clot in my liver. I wasn't making anything up. I wasn't wrongly reacting. I was acting like any human would. To be told I was essentially lying ruins any trust or confidence in the NHS in general. Do not go to this hospital if you want to be treated in a kind and caring way. I understand the NHS are under pressure... Just don't take it out on the patients... Once again 0 stars from me. So disappointed and upset by my experience."

The building environment was clean and inviting. Modern equipment. I always found a parking spot and was allowed to park for free as it was a long treatment period otherwise the travelling expenses would have been substantial.M.Bevan

1043,"Accident and emergency services - Phenomenal given the current pressure! - Everyone in ED from reception staff, nurses, docs, porters and the volunteers were so friendly and apologetic about the wait. I felt so sorry seeing people coming in and huffing about the estimated time to see someone - it's not the staff's fault! Everyone I saw was friendly, helpful and thorough. They're all doing a brilliant job and don't get enough praise for what they're doing. Thank you!! "
5546,"Children's & Adolescent Services - Children's Burns and plastics unit - My daughter burnt her hand and after visiting my local A&E we were referred to QMC children's Burns and plastics unit. All I can say is...what a fab bunch of people! My daughter is 2 so didn't like sitting still too much but they were great with her, distracted her when they were doing the not nice bits and really kept her calm and relaxed. They also got us booked in quickly for our follow up appointment, and saw the same people. Couldn't fault them at all. What a wonderful team to put children at ease at a not very nice time! "
3589,The food. Nice nurses. It's brilliant nothing needs changing.
3718,Long wait-2 1/2 hours with a broken leg- the triage nurse should be able to take a quick look and assess whether any minors need to be fast tracked

I was put on waiting list for an urgent cancer operation. Had a right hemincolectomy carried out at the Spire hospital on 18 February under the NHS and went home a few days later.

5013,"Helpful friendly staff, but the reason not one was of the car parking, no spaces available, had to drive around the car parks a few times to get one, which took the edge of the visit."
8758,Home treatment team waste of time - Daughter under home treatment team gets told same thing at every visit has been let down twice in two weeks by not having visits when told someone will come out the next day when phone to ask for a tough time told not down for visit .very poor communication which adds to and increases patients anxiety.make things sound so easy and can talk yo you and bake you feel like your stupid for not being able to do or cope with what they say.
6269,
3997,"Gynaecology - Surprised - Upon entering the building, I was greeted by a nurse who instructed me to wash & sanitize my hands then book in at reception. Upon returning after washing etc, I just said to this nurse ‚Äòis it ok for me to go in? '. She said ‚ÄòI've just told you to go in haven't I' in not a very nice manner I might add! I appreciate she was texting on her mobile phone so can only assume I annoyed her by interrupting her conversation. I was merely looking for reassurance. To this nurse I would just like to say that you have no idea what a distressing week I have suffered including a death and hope you don't make anyone else feel as upset as I do. To the rest of the staff - you were all lovely. "

They were very thorough and caring, talking through everything. Luckily, I didn't have to go to hospital, very impressed with the way they handled the call. However, I rang almost an hour before the call was actually assigned to them which was much too long given the circumstances at first. "

I have come away with not only a treatment plan but feel so much better emotionally. Thank you so much for your help it is really appreciated. "
7595,"Very nice lady, easy to talk to."
162,Can't recommend highly enough - I recently suffered a knee injury which left me unable to walk and was very distressed as I have an 8 week old baby to care for. I was able to get an appointment at the clinic incredibly quickly and even on New Year's Eve the staff were caring and professional and more than happy to help and talk me through the procedure. I felt instantly reassured that I was in the right hands and would recommend to anyone needing a scan 
8292,Better co-ordination between doctors. Nursing staff excellent except for 1 night shift
7457,Accident and emergency services - Fantastic - I visited A&E today and the staff were amazing. For the first time in weeks I felt like me and my medical needs mattered. They were so understanding and professional. The infection controls in place made me feel safe considering I have COPD and the nurses and doctor that dealt with me made me feel calmer and reassured. Thank you to all.

The radiologist saw me within 5 mins of my arrival. She was friendly, courteous and very professional. She made me feel very comfortable and at ease. What a lovely lady! Thank you for a very pleasant visit"
3485,"Accident and emergency services - Great staff - I spent 18 hours in a&e but I was treated within 5 hours. The problem is not with the hospital. The problem is with the stupidity of the public.if you are well enough to take a large pizza with you to eat while waiting you can't be that Ill .also time wasters who have drunk to much alcohol and then after taking valuable doctors time go home.if these selfish morons were sorted and sent to a place to sober up the poor hard pressed doctors and nurses could do their jobs.Dont blame the hospital take a long look at yourself and ask do I really need to there.After being admitted into a ward again the selfish loutish behaviour of some of these people who make everyone's life more difficult I would suggest better communication from staff would help for example on my day of discharge the Consulant didn't have the common decency to speak to me.i was discharged with no explanation or letter I had to visit my own gp to find out I need further treatment Do you really think this is acceptable.Also I found because I'm older I was there was a assumption that I was not capable of making decisions which I found extremely insulting!,,,, Also my last concern was the standard of cleaning again this needs attention.I don't think the all the cuts that our government have helped there But the country has voted for more of the same so who is to blame? "
5724,Extremely helpful and caring
9714,"Ophthalmology - not brilliant - I felt that the staff are not really experienced or trained in dealing with traumatised patients. The nurse who did the initial eye assessment was lovely and helpful. But the consultation was itself an ordeal. I found the optometrist patting me on the shoulder in a patronising way very off putting, and unprofessional. A female doctor was asked to examine my corneal scar, as the optometrist said it did not look like a herpes scar which I had suspected all along that it was. The doctor was abrupt but did diagnose a herpes scar, but then proceeded to speak behind my back, assuming I had not heard. I apologised for being so nervous but was made aware that I was unusual and taking up a lot of time. The optometrist had left us in the room for a good ten minutes while she went looking for some eye drops so a lot of time was spent waiting. A pity the doctor could not have had more empathy as I had to take my disabled husband, in a wheel chair to the appointment, and he had to sit in with me. "

2881,"Really worrying when. You see groups of people together on the beach in the parks and Sutton park, authorities doing nothing to control the numbers. Weston superM shutting of hospital admissions as covoid increasing again 2 weeks after last BHW. GET A GRIP"
8560,"Gynaecology - Great professional care - I had a short planned stay after major surgery. From arrival on Eden Ward to leaving, my care was amazing! I was always kept well informed, staff were efficient, considerate, personable, professional and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. The ward is very busy and staff are working so hard and excelled themselves despite being in the middle of a pandemic. I was regularly checked, meds and obs done regularly, I couldn't have asked for more. From cleaning staff, to kitchen staff, to HCA's, to nurses and consultants, all were efficient and delivered high quality of care! Only one criticism and negative comment is the hot food was diabolical, it really need to be looked at and improved. Overall I want to whole heartedly thank you for your care and compassion."
8765,A 1 star hospital - As an ‚Äòoutstanding' hospital I could not equate this to the treatment received by general / colorectal team at East Surrey Hospital which fell far short of this. As you are not allowed to give names / details on reviews I can only say treatment and communication far from satisfactory 
1738,"Neurosurgery - Amazing team - I visited the scs clinic numerous times prior to surgery, the entire team I had were amazing, my consultant explained everything clearly and put me totally at ease. The specialist nurse was just outstanding, I couldn't have wished for a better team to take care of me, knowing that they are a phone call away if I get any issues is brilliant. Even though I'm no longer in the hospital I still feel I've got the support of the entire team if needed. So thank you for all you've done and will continue to do for me. "
147,"Dear God why did I come to this hospital, well turns out mid Wales had no hospitals apparently so when my daughter took ill while I was on holiday this useless building was the nearest option we had. Honestly I should have kept driving to a real hospital in Walsall or Wolverhampton. Next time even if I'm run over on the car park to this hospital I'm insisting they take me to a real hospital."
1700,"My boy is back home!!! Thank you @UHSFT for looking after my gorgeous life partner (feel like we are too old to call boyfriend ü§£) Stew so well the last 10 days.

5946,"Brilliant People - Fantastic team working through a pandemic, they all concentrate solely on the patient. I have had several eye injections and each one has been carried out by truly professional people and perhaps more importantly lovely people . The knowledge of the team is amazing, I was informed from day 1 what my diagnosis was and how I would be treated, the consultants are amazing and even referred me to the doctors for a full MOT. Thank you to everyone at Boston House "
927,I definitely such great staff
3760,"Accident and emergency services - Super friendly and efficient service at A&E - I am unable to reply to your SMS survey so am leaving it here. I recently visited A&E on Saturday, April 18th. The welcome was extremely friendly despite the difficult circumstances currently due to the corona virus outbreak. I was seen in a logical order by the ward nurse, the A&E Doctor and then a Urology Specialist. Everyone were very professional and kept me informed about what was going to happen next. It seemed like a department in good control and with great collaboration between staff. "
527,"the doctor belittled me and treated me in the worst way possible, I left crying and it has significantly effected my mental health since"
1262,"Today I visited the A&E with my 1year old child. He had an open wound on forehead which was bleeding, I was given a green card and asked to wait. Our turn came after 3hours. The lady that attended me told that he isn't a qualified nurse and is covering the shift of the nurse who was supposed to arrive from Queen's hospital but hasn't arrived. I was handed in a bandage and asked to do the dressing at home. Upon complaining about the service, I was asked to wait further for 40min and my child's wound was sealed with a skin glue. When I arrived home, the wound had opened again and was oozing blood. Pathetic service!!! "

9431,
4895,Accident and emergency services - No Response - Mother taken to A&E early this morning. Trying to phone department & main switchboard with no one answering despite 4 attempts each lasting around 10 minutes. I dont expect anyone from the manor will get back about this given the reviews with no replies.
2291,The nursing staff pay more attention to what is written down rather than listen to the patients immediate needs PRIVATE
6454,Staff were all fantastic
381,"Alisha Margetts (name) was my midwife, I am so grateful to her.l So positive, so encouraging, made labour so much easier and smoother. Thank You so much.Special thanks to Lilly Berry (name) too. All the staff were so lovely and willing to help. It really puts you at ease and smoothes the process. You should all be proud of yourselves."

5898,Massive thank you to the paramedics @NWAmbulance and the doctors and crew of @NWAirAmbulance who responded to my father in law yesterday in Cheadle Hulme. You are all amazing and we are very lucky to have your services üåà
4935,Accident and emergency services - Long waiting times - Took my child there and the waiting times is like 4hours plus. They should make the patient aware of what the waiting times are. In this case I was not told and had to wait in a room with no windows on an extremely hot day. It was really warm that day and being the childrens a&e at least they could have cooled the place. It was soo uncomfortable sitting in that waiting room and my child was unsettled throughout. I only found out how long I've got to wait after enquiring from the desk. Please children a&e work on your communication with patients and please keep the waiting room cool it's very uncomfortable to be sitting there for 4 hours plus in this hot weather. 
3777,RSCH from past personal experience and on this occasion have always provided very efficient and courteous NHS service. The doctors and staff are brilliant. I am very much grateful for their work. By the way the Ward are now very clean and are in good condition.
7563,"I wouldn't choose to be in hospital but I am eternally grateful for the #care #professionalism and #compassion I have received @UHP_NHS. Today I was so proud to have a @livewellsw #TNA providing care, a fantastic role, delivering #excellence @GillMillerPlym"
786,"Midwives on this ward unfortunately let down the whole of the pregnancy care I received from booking to postnatal care.Everything else has been excellent.Several things happened but essentially it can be categorised to:- uncompassionate care - no support for my mental health and well-being, despite the fact I was in for induction due to mental health reasons.- not involved in decision making- not listened to or communicated to adequately"
2721,"Big thanks the wonderful staff @LG_NHS and @EvelinaLondon for looking after baby J. Assessed yesterday morning, transferred to Evelina neurology team this morning, MRI and consultant review done and home by lunchtime. The NHS is amazing #NHSheroes #relievedparents"
2137,Accident and emergency services - Staff wonderful - I visited A and E today with a heart problem. I was treated with the wonderful care by the very well trained staff and consultants there.

2568,Thank god for our lovely local hospital - an utter gem! 
6681,"Took my wife for her routine blood tests. Few staff seem to be rude, never greet patients with a smile and often dealt with our queries with unprofessional tone. It costs nothing to smile! I hope this feedback gets read by the management team."

9613,"I've got a muscle injury which needs looking at, so I've come to #Homertonhospital. It's quiet, clean, friendly... I'm just tweeting to say do go to hospital if you need to and usually would. Don't go untreated because you think hospitals are going nuts with virus patients"
3728,We were visiting the area on holidays and my son had a medical issue. Off we went to a+enexpecting hours of wait. We were seen in the equivalent of a minor injuries unit and in and out within an hour. My son had painkillers and given antibiotics. Staff were friendly and helpful and put my son at ease.

Friendly, professional and really caring staff have helped me get to grips with the machine. Thank you all for such a first class service."
7126,"Maternity services - Wonderful staff - I have been to the hospital for my 20 weeks scan and I was very pleased to see how nice the 2 doctors who saw me were. We tried all we could to get a certain photo of baby's spine but he clearly was not in a good mood for a photo shoot HAPPY but the doctors were patient and one even gave me a bar of chocolate hoping that might help the baby to turn. Lovely staff and great services, would happily recommend the Maternity Ward at Medway Hospital. "
6009,"Couldn't give 0 stars for this joke of NHS service, wasted 8h waiting to just been sent back home with nothing. Came here after being assaulted 3 days ago on night out with heavy blow / kick in the head, till today I had head aches and dizziness with loss of focus and concentration. I've came in at 6pm, was quickly checked by nurse and put off to waiting room, asked how long it will take, got said its approximately 4h. Sitting in waiting room I've already noticed that everyone that came in has been given same answer. After almost 5h wait I've asked when will I get seen by doctor, got told that there's 1 person before me, shouldn't be long now. Then hour after hour, waiting and asking when I've still got same answer - 1 person before me, shouldn't take long. Then when seen by doctor he just briefly asked what's going on and briefly touched my head few times and told me that everything is fine, no scan needed (I do think doctor had CT scanner in his palms, lol), been told to go back home and come back if I still had head aches in 5 days. 8h waiting for 10min . Total waste of 8h just to be dismissed / couldn't be bothered to get me throu scan at 2am at night. Came back home now at almost 3am, not only having bad head ache but with my bottom hurting as well sitting on them buss stop like chairs, waiting for this 10min viewing! This is a joke. Judging by waiting 3h been told I'm next, and seeing how slow other people sitting next to me got in and sent back and in and back (and there was only a bunch, maybe 10pp) seems like Doctor takes 3h to see 1 patient. Looking far in to A&E rooms looked like quite quiet as well, no serious emergencys going on or staff running around busy. This experience seriously opened my eyes, how bad and flawed NHS service really is! "
8190,The communication in Rotherham hospital is horrendous. Absolutely HATE the place! ü§Ø
8720,Nurses have been lovely and having her own room has been fantasti c. She i s suffering with her arthritis but staff have arranged her own doctor to come see her for it. The staff and nurses work Very well togeather.
3792,"I was taken to A&E by ambulance on Saturday night. Paramedics were brilliant, warm and friendly, they had done first examination carefully before we went to hospital. Reduced my stress level, even I had too much pain and worry felt in safe hands. In the hospital, nurse was nice. Not waited too much got my blood and urine tests very quick. Doctor was nice. I'd like to mention all of their name here but I wasn't able to keep anything in my mind that time. Staff was brilliant, service was good. I was well- treated. Many many thanks to all of them."

3574,"Was In a&e for 5+ hours Not enough seating for patients, people sitting on the floor and windows as they isn't any space. Floor is littered with dirt and empty cups.

7071,"Very attentive care, nothing was too much trouble"
6788,I'm currently a patient on the antenatal ward at wythenshaw hospital and this is honestly the worst hospital I have ever been to. my own consultant who put my plan of care in place has been ignored on every occasion and they seem to think their plans are better. even if that means I have been sat here for 7 weeks bleeding every day! the consultants are rude and if you voice your concerns or disagree with them they just don't come and see you at all! this hospital need serious investigation as there are babies lives at stake and these people don't care! 
4610,"Big shout out to @KettGeneral, paediatric A&E and the fab paramedics - all so kind, professional and calm in these crazy times. Thank you from a relieved mum"
1322,"Service was excellent, couldnt ask for more."
6883,"My counsellor never minimised me - Counselling has given me the opportunity to talk freely and opening to someone on who is on my side, but who also challenges me to look at myself in a different light. Counselling has helped me to slowly peel back the layers, because my counsellor never minimised me or shut me down, or tried to put a positive spin on things. This experience has given me a different perspective on how to manage my feelings. I'm no longer so hard on myself for feeling negative feelings, and I'm more inclined to drop my barriers and talk more openly with other people in my life. This was an important thing for me to work through and will help me to live better with the uncertainty that living with cancer brings."
3888,"Very efficient, I felt safe and looked after "
1508,"Thank you @MTWnhs for providing such outstanding care to my 6 year old yesterday. Absolutely faultless care and attention and behind the PPE you could see through their eyes such genuinely lovely, kind and happy staff. Thank you! https://t.co / Oij2i7UgBd"

1864,The worst NHS hospital does not do your job to urgently 3 4 hours and then call the security to give you out because he says they are busy the one who wants to say something that is not true will have been recorded and I have the footage
2169,"Excellent Service - Attended the Walk in Clinic, was quickly moved through the system until finally seeing a Doctor, all Staff I dealt with were patient not just with me but some whose first language was not English. The Hospital was clean and seemed to have a happy workforce.Impressed."
4730,"Feels brilliant to be able to share newt guidelines with Walsall nursing homes. Important to be able to share information regarding crushing etc of meds with care home staff looking after frail, vulnerable people @LeanneS56150320 @AbdulRahimAlam_ @WalsallAdultCom @WalsallHcareNHS"
220,Noisy at night - staff shouting. Aled (name) - very good person. Night of second I tried to speak to member of staff was dismissive of my enquiry.
6847,"Unfortunately I have 2 children who dance. So we're hear ever other month with injurys. We're always seen pretty quick usually around the 2 hour mark. The only down side to todays visits is they've took the cash mashine from the jubilee wing. I did not know this and had no cash to get home in a taxi, my daughter had badly damaged her foot and couldn't walk. Lucky we saw a friend who give us a lift Please reconise this cash mashine is needed. Many people will be in the situation I was in tonight."
2999,"Awful hospital - kept me waiting for 5 hours with a kidney infection to discharge me saying nothing was wrong, came in again the next day with a letter from my hospital requesting a scan and was kept waiting 7 hours only to be told the department in closed and that I do have a kidney infection, went in the next day for my scan and was given the wrong one - The worst experience I have ever had at a hospital - Never come here by yourself if you can avoid it, you need someone to pester the nurses or you'll be left for hours"
3920,"Every person I came across Was very helpful, professional and polite, extremely clean.Mr Read my surgeon explained exactly what he was going to do for me . Thanks"
3212,"Amazing Centre - I had my hip replaced at the end of September and the operation was successful. As a young adult I was extremely looked after by the nurses, anaesthetists and my surgeon. They made me feel comfortable and safe especially during this pandemic. The aftercare on the ward was amazing all the staff treated me with respect and we're so helpful and caring. The physiotherapist on the ward gave me confidence to move more and the porters, cleaners and catering staff were all very friendly. "
8178,"Brilliant service from @boltonnhsft today. Phoned me at 12pm, appointment at 2, x-ray, diagnosis and plaster at 3pm for tibia fracture. No running for at least 6 weeks but at least I know what the problem has been. https://t.co/IUpnaneg54"

9850,"Maternity services - Hit and miss - Had all my maternity care here - from booking appointment to jabs for baby . I dealt with nurses, midwives, consultants and pediatricians. 1/4 staff we dealt with were amazing, really went above and beyond to give us care with consideration, dignity and medical professionalism. Most did not. Failures ranged from basics like not saying hello / goodbye making awkward situations even weirder, to not explaining and following up on tests on me and the baby which led to more painful and unnecessary tests on my newborn. They did not provide me with pain relief when asked for. Lots of contradicting and surly advice on everything from managing stitches to feeding baby. Would definitely not give birth there again."
7562,Very long waiting times. But helpful when you get to see someone.
3770,For the age of the hospital it's five stars
717,Excellent team as always. Let me know why there was a small delay. Courteous and professional and also friendly. In the current circumstances they deserve the highest praise.

Outstanding professionalism and very pleasant. I was enormously impressed. So appreciative. Cheers"
3053,This afternoon I was in ED with our elderly neighbour. To say I was impressed with the vascular Drs and trainee ACP who attended to her is an understatement. They showed such heartfelt compassion and a calmness that was surreal in such a busy department. @UHP_NHS @AnnJamesNHS
4644,"Excellent! - Attended at 8am, hoping to avoid hassle, delay and disruption of contacting our surgery. Not disappointed - seen promptly by extremely helpful and thorough nurse. He contacted surgery who then phoned me and immediately organised prescription for collection.

4848,"And special thanks to the nurses at @RNOHnhs. I'm out of words to thank you and you brush me off every time but I still well up when I think of your care. Nicky, Caro, Gabriella, Charlotte, Shrijana, Ayan and Janette. Above and beyond doesn't begin to describe you. Thank you! X"

4622,Don't know - Bad care and hygiene - I was placed into hospital with a c.diff infection so moved into a side room. I had no access to a toilet or shower as there wasn't one in the room and I wasn't allowed to use the wards ones because of my infection. The nurse brought me a commode and I explained to them that I unfortunately can't use them as my body wouldn't let me but they didn't listen to me. I also went days not knowing what was happening with me due my consultant not coming to see me.
6152,1 excellent | Staff amazing in the scanner room.. But felt alone waiting

8194,"Children's & Adolescent Services - Amazing playworker - My son was in today for a scheduled operation. He has many other medical needs including adhd with extreme anxiety when out of his routine. Upon arriving at the ward, the playworker was incredible. She helped to calm him, talked through anaesthetic and what would happen in surgery. She really understood him and his needs better than doctor or nurse who has ever dealt with him. She ensured he was calm and comfortable and went above and beyond, consistently checking on him, and even escorting him to theatre and helping him in the pre op room when he had another wobble. I really couldn't have done today without her, I doubt my son would have gone through with the operation. She is an incredible example of the importance of playworkers in the hospital. I wish I could do more to say thank you HAPPY The other staff were also lovely, welcoming and easy to talk to. The ward was lovely and clean as usual, with my son particularly enjoying the den area. Outstanding ward, with incredible staff who are truly there for the patients. I hope the need for another visit doesn't arise but I know if it does, my children are in the best hands. "
2097,My shock of having heart failure - It felt as though I was having a dream and l would wake up and be back to my normal life. The fact that it was within the early days of COVID lockdown. I had high blood pressure for many years but well controlled and led a very busy healthy lifestyle so my world was turned upside down. In a way l am still coming to terms with this event but without the support and excellent care l received from the Cardiac outreach team and the counselling service l have received l think l would be in a darker place.

8364,I had been having Physiotherapy and Motomed treatment in the Community this has now been cut and the person who used to do my treatment she's gone! Norfolk Community Healthcare Trust are as bad as Ticcs used to be the defunct other operator! Now I get no Physiotherapy or Motomed treatment this is downright discusting I'm in agony and these lot do absolutely nothing about as much use as a Hornet on a Nudist Beach completely useless this service has been destroyed! 
4763,"Gynaecology - Repeated appointment cancellation- exactly 2 weeks to date - My appointment was made in March for July 2021, cancelled (exactly 2 weeks to the July appointment) to September- 2021. I called pal nhs and it was rescheduled to August 2021. Now it's been cancelled ( exactly 2 weeks to the August 2021 appointment) and automatically rescheduled to December 2021. Day off work - cancelled again, growth increasing enormously. I find this occurrence fraudulent "

3214,Short waiting times. All areas were kept clean and social distancing was made easy.
6992,I think the nursing staff at the RSCH are second to none. From personal experience I would not want to be anywhere else to be treated. Thankyou everybody.

411,The staff could not have been more attentive and caring when my 92 year old father attended.he was very impressed and happy with his care.
8450,"So first of I will start with a postive, some of the nurses and CSWs where amazing with my husband and couldn't do enough for him, however there does seem to be a culture of some of the staff talking to the patients like they are children and even arguing with them...for a rehab I'm shocked at how little rehabilation there actually is, there website is all singing and all dancing and what the patients get is entirely a different story which saddens me, these people are left sat in a chair or bed watching TV, there is no mental stimulation given, these people have all acquired brain injurys from various problems, and yet there left sat doing nothing for almost 10 hours a day! This needs to be looked into during these times of COVID, where family can only visit for an 1 hour day"
900,Ophthalmology - Just great to see clearly again - I would like to thank the surgeon who removed the cataract from my right eye on Monday 21st. He was patient with me ( a compulsive wriggler) and did a cracking job. Please pass on my thanks to him. Best regards James Allison
6093,Staff are so understanding and my consultant mr valentine from ent who I have been seeing for the last 10 years has just been brilliant he really has helped with my condition over this period of time I cant talk highly enough of him changed my life around and understood what I was going through just so professional in his field

9262,Absolute disgrace under staffed waiting time 7 hours to be seen.members of the public helping me and my dad as I passed out on the floor and was having some sort of seziure nurses all too busy and very abrupt not a nice experience at all.
791,Cataract Surgery - Waiting long time for cataract op - Waiting since 2019 I know covid has halted lots surgeries but still don't know when is going to happen would like update to keep me informed as it's seriously affecting my vision
530,Don't know - Incredibly rude nurse - After a visit as advised by 111 we were seen by an incredibly rude nurse. She had absolutely no manners and talked very rudely. The healthcare assistant we first saw and the receptionist was very polite and friendly so it was very shocking to have these treatment from the nurse. 
2354,Pain
9404,"I spent a week in this hospital and it was a nightmare week from hell. I have never received such thoughtless, uncaring treatment. There was very little compassion and diagnosis news was delivered with an indifferent, and cruel manner and then you were left to get on with it - your worry and panic. I was left with no dignity or respect feeling totally helpless and in total despair."
9560,We were seen promptly-staff explained what was happening and what the next steps were.
2514,"Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery - Day treatment unit fabulous care - My daughter 17 had to have some teeth removed. Surgeon, anaesthetist nurses etc were all excellent such high standards of care. A special mention to the cleaning staff ward was spotlessly clean. "

4886,Everyone was very kind and helpful.
2598,"General Surgery - Sanderson suite staff brilliant - Breast operation today 7th jan in Sanderson suite. All staff were so lovely on the ward and theatre, explained everything fully at each stage during the day. Lifted my spirits too. Kept checking if I was ok and had some good laughs too!!! After my operation they were again brilliant. Making sure I was still ok. I saw first hand how hard everyone of them works, always on the go, never stopping even sometimes missing meals!!! It's so hard for them during this pandemic time but they get on with the job they do and continue to make us the patients comfortable and as relaxed as possible. One last thing the toast / cup of tea was amazing and well needed ha. Huge hugs to everyone of you. Keep safe all üíñ and thank you again üëç"
9227,Just visited Solihull Hospital for blood tests. Parked up and back out within 30 mins. First class service by @uhbtrust
1108,Urgent care centre - Fobbed off and unhelpful - I was asked by my GP to attend urgent care as lumps have appeared and had to be seen to in an urgent matter. After waiting quite a few hours I saw a GP who told me that they do not do any investigations there and I need to go back to my GP and ask them to refer me for tests as an outpatient. I left feeling very upset considering there is cancer in my family and have now not slept for 2 nights with worry and feeling the lumps and discomfort that comes with them. I used to rate Chorley hospital but sadly it has gone down in my estimations.
2851,"The last month has been very difficult, lost my dad to covid19 @DudleyGroupNHS and I have been in @RWT_NHS for 2 weeks needing CPAP ventilation. EVERY member of staff was caring, confident, remarkable, reassuring Thank you from the bottom of my heart. https://t.co / ABBMS0gXxV"

9695,"I was admitted a week ago (9/10/21) the team in resus were so friendly and helpful, I was then sent up to CCU and the staff were absolutely amazing they took the time to explain everything and make sure you're comfortable. I was then moved to ward 24 which at first i wasn't so impressed but after a good nights sleep the day staff were more pleasant. Big shout out to Becky Rider in the emergency department for putting me at ease, and Porter Jason Turner for poppping back to check in on me throughout the week really made me feel more at ease, and Doctor James Woodcock too he took the time to explain things even stopped to answer questions as and when I thought of them even between dealing with other patients. All those staff that go above and beyond are the ones that make the experience of being in hospital easier and less traumatic."
6130,"Previously I had 2 babies at Northwick Park. I had my third baby here 2 weeks ago. The care I received from the midwives on the recovery and postnatal wards here was absolutely fantastic and so much better than previous experiences. Chloe and Raksha on the recovery ward were brilliant. Just 2 of the kind, diligent and respectful women who looked after me wonderfully. I am very grateful. My surgeon Dr George and anesthetists for my c section could not have been any better. Reassuring, professional and again, very kind. They did everything to put me at ease when I was feeling very scared! For these staff I would give this hospital 5 stars. However, on the day of my c section I had to deal with a Dr who was extremely unprofessional, condescending and discourteous, which has really marred my birth experience. This Dr came in to see me after I had been waiting for my c section for hours to attempt to persuade me (on the day!) to have an induction instead. She told me she didn't understand my reasons for wanting an elective cesarean. I had seen an obstetrician a week prior to this who had talked me through my options and agreed to this c section. The morning of the procedure was beyond an inappropriate time to try and talk me out of it. All of this would have been fine, but the way she spoke to me was so revoltingly patronising I felt compelled to document it here. She 'quizzed' me on what I knew about the procedure, attempted to correct me on everything I said, and when I stood firm and maintained that I didn't want an induction, replied petulantly with well it will be an hour and a half wait. As though I were being punished for disobedience. Her whole attitude and lack of respect for me was infuriating and somewhat spoilt what should have been a very happy day. I think her first name was Nanna and she needs some support with how to speak to and treat patients. Especially patients who are already frightened and anxious. Her lack of care was concerning."

619,"Horrifying experience at King's Mill Hospital. After suffering a bad reaction to one of the covid vaccines which landed me in A&E with suspected blood clots, my GP recommended an alternative vaccine as a second dose, but weeks later when I arrived at King's Mill they wanted to override his decision and give me same vaccine which caused tremendous problems in the first place. I tried my best to explain but they wouldn't listen, too keen on pushing the default vaccine. I walked out without my second vaccine."

1952,Children's & Adolescent Services - Great care - My baby received excellent care in a&e on christmas day. And excellent care on boxing day at hascombe ward and surgery. Really impressed with the level of compassion and professionalism in these difficult times
6819,Gynaecology - Hysteroscopy - fabulous service. - I went for a hysteroscopy at New Alderley house Macclesfield this morning terrified after reading all the horror stories online. But please don't believe them all - the staff at New Alderley house that do this are amazing. The consultant takes the time to explain exactly what will happen and your dignity is preserved at all times. There is an amazing nurse who will hold your hand and talk the whole way through the procedure to distract you. What a lovely lady she deserves a medal! The procedure itself takes minutes and the pain was really bearable - and nothing compared to period pain and childbirth! they numb your cervix so once that's done then the only other bit that hurts a bit is when they take the biopsy - but it's a only a few seconds and stops immediately. Afterwards you can take your time getting dressed etc there is no hurry. Overall it couldn't have been a better experience for me for what is quite an invasive procedure. I write this review as there is much bad press about this procedure - but please take a balanced view of feedback and realise that people who don't have a bad experience generally don't write reviews. There is nothing to fear about this and at New Alderley house you are in the best hands.

5765,"Our journey with BCRM was, as expected, very emotional and overwhelming at times... But that's any and all fertility treatment. We found our journey to ICSI to be well supported with the staff being open and accessible throughout. We created a particular bond with Carrie who guided us through so much of our treatment and was the friendly face and supportive hug (pre-covid) that we needed. Carrie performed my transfer and our 7 week viability scan and her warmth made the whole process so much more calm. We are one of the lucky ones and are expecting our first baby in April. We had 3 (unsuccessful) rounds of Clomid before ICSI but this worked first time and we couldn't be happier. We had the majority of our treatment before Covid hit the UK and we were devistated when all treatment was cancelled. It was a stressful time and BCRM did what they could to stay available. Communication during this time was hit and miss but noone could have prepared for this so I tried to stay calm and accept that things were out of our hands. BCRM create a warm environment for one of the hardest times of your life, and if you get lucky will be the last step on your journey to parenthood. It can be just magic."

4197,I was referred by Haslemere hospital and once I had checked in at The Royal Surrey I was taken for treatment very quickly. The practitioner in A &E who treated me was efficient and kind and explained clearly what the process would be and what sort of pain I might experience before putting my wrist in traction. I was given gas and air while she manipulated the bones into the correct position. I could see from the X-rays that she had achieved an excellent result. She gave me exercises to do and information leaflets. My visit probably lasted less than an hour.

3613,"Got told to come an hour earlier to the appointment, then turns out that they hadn't altered the appointment anywhere else. We were waiting around for an hour, when we first asked what was going on the nurse just placated us, said she'd come back and didn't. When we asked the second time was when we where told what happened, honestly a little frustrated as it caused my mother a panic attack and because we'd wasted a hour of our time, with no good excuse."

80,"Accident and emergency services - Professional - My daughter (age 14) came to A&E At around 8pm on a Saturday night with a bleeding head injury after being hit by a stone on the beach. We found the staff warm and helpful. We were dealt with swiftly and informed and updated throughout from triage to the ward nurse and doctor. We were aware of the wait time and the process was explained and clearly visible on the display screen. Some of the text however concerning mask wearing guidance was not legible from the waiting area due to size and colour of text. When my daughters injury became more of an emergency situation the staff were calm, confident, deliberate in their actions and kept us as calm as possible through what was a frightening situation. They talked my daughter through what they were doing, addressing her directly making sure she was aware of what was happening. Their friendly manner helped ease a traumatic situation and they made sure that my daughter was warm, we were given a drink (nurse checked with the doctor before giving a drink to my daughter) and offered food. Stitches were necessary for the wound and the doctor explained why they were necessary and talked through the process as he did it. They answered our questions clearly and if unsure sought the necessary advice. We felt well looked after and cared for. "

137,"Gynaecology - Outstanding care - I went into friarage hospital as an outpatient for a routine procedure under local anaesthetic, upon arrival it quickly became apparent that I wasn't expected due to a clerical error even though my letter clearly stated I had an appointment, I think the staff picked up on my disappointment as I had been awaiting this procedure for some time but due to covid it had been cancelled however the staff rallied round to get basic notes e mailed across and the consultant agreed to see me and go ahead with the procedure. The nursing staff that cared for me were outstanding and explained every element and what I was to expect including managing my pain throughout. I have never felt so safe and cared for so Thankyou all staff on gynaecology at the friarage you really did go the extra mile."

7837,"The stay itself was a 1. In difficult circumstances, the nurses were brilliant - attentive, patient and caring. I cant fault my procedure either - theatre nurse, anaesthetist and surgeons all fantastic. Unfortunately my A and E experience before the op was not good at all and the after care non existent. I have had no follow up appointment and have given up after 3 hours on the phone trying to persuade the Royal Surrey that I exist. My discharge letter had no name of the surgeon or anaesthetist. Luckily my local gp surgery has taken over. So a brilliant service in some areas and negligent in others."
7583,"I took my relative into PIU. I have nothing but admiration and praise for the staff on there. You are all amazing!!!

2954,"Deeply disappointing - Suffering as I do from severe depression as a registered disabled person, I made repeated phone calls to Health in Mind. Try as hard as I might I could not get an answer. I tried for the best part of a week. Eventually, someone answered the call. Finally, an appointment was made. When I arrived at Tekhnicon House in Braintree there was nowhere to park. After finally managing to park, and entered the building, which has no signs, to my complete dismay, the receptionist told me that my therapist was off ill. No-one had had the decency to notify me of this cancellation. I asked to speak to the service manager, and was told she was unavailable as she was said to be at lunch. Who takes lunch at 3.30 in the afternoon? Based on my experience, Health in Mind, Mid-Essex IAPT are as much use to mental health patients as a chocolate fire guard. This service deserves to be taken over by Virgin Care. Thankfully I have private health insurance, but not everyone does of course. What happens to those patients who are failed by this service and have nowhere else to go? HPFT need to get their house in order. Health in Mid is not fit for purpose. "

9726,1 very good | Was treated as soon as I arrived was told what was going on. When leaving all medical were done .and a follow up call today to make sure I was OK
4185,Treatment at the E.M.U. - My wife became very unwell and was referred to Abingdon E. M. U. by her GP. The treatment she received was absolutely outstanding. From the moment we arrived we were treated very kindly and thoughtfully by everyone we came into contact with. The friendly and slightly relaxed atmosphere in the unit did much to reassure us but we were in no doubt about the thoroughness and professionalism of everyone there. It was necessary to attend on three consecutive days over the New Year Holiday for my wife to be stabilised with antibiotics and for investigations and each time we had the same excellent treatment and nothing was too much trouble. Thank you all. We saw the NHS at its very best in your E. M. U.
4016,"Good service - Good service and waiting time isn't as long than other clinics. Staff are kind and friendly. However, it would be great if they can include what area or floor to go to on SMS messages or even indicate clearly on the website. When arriving I didn't know where to go and ended up going up and down the stairs. not great when having knee pains. "
8463,I think the staff were very efficient and friendly
4195,"Thank you so much @TheAA_UK for the free roadside assistance, taking the nail out of the tyre, re-inflating and getting me back on my way to @WestHertsNHS! Really appreciate it (this was earlier)"
6313,"After an urgent referral from Specsavers opticians I was called the very next day to attend the Eye Hospital. The service they offer is second to none and cannot fault the care I received. Each and every one of the staff I saw were kind, courteous and reassuring. We should be proud of our NHS and the services they offer."
8777,"Don't know - Parking - I came on a heavily rainy day. Both the letter I received and the sign posts in the parking lot instructed that the parking is free for 3 hours but you must put a notice from the machine. I couldn't find any machines and there was no one around to ask.in the end I parked outside and had to walk in heavy rain there and back. When I asked inside the hospital, I was told that there's no need to worry about it..... At these times when everything is difficult, I would hope that someone will take the time to put some explanation so that people can have one less thing to worry about. Especially when we consider elderly and frail people have to visit a hospital. "
5664,"I was told by my GP to call the reception to arrange an appointment for a blood test. The receptionist I was speaking to could not have been less helpful, just told me to call 111 and said I don't need an appointment for a blood test as it is a walk in center. But there are no walk ins permitted during covid, 19, she just said to call 111. Didn't even give me a chance to book an appointment. Please bring back online appointment bookings as it it much more reliable."
5829,"All the team are friendly, caring and supportive with nothing being too much trouble. The hospital is clean, well maintained with good signposting. Clerical staff are also helpfull."
6138,"Good communication from start of my referral even though department is closed at the moment. The physiotherapist, Ailis, was very thorough with her ÔøΩexamination' via video, very professional and friendly. No complaints whatsoever. Looking forward to starting my exercises."
5761,General Medicine - Great doctor - Took my 1 year old to see the emergency GP today in K&C. All round positive experience with a call back from 111 in 30 minutes and an appt within 2 hours. The GP was exceptionally patient and thorough and made me feel like it was ok to be there even before he'd located her established tonsillitis. Thank you so much for such a positive experience. 
1582,Today I realised the sorry state of the @NHSuk having had a pre planned heart op cancelled at @BartsHospital despite being on the ward for 5hrs! Glad to be a statistic of NHS failure..
2716,"Very smooth process, friendly staff. Gave full explanations so I knew what to expect. Couldn't have gone better."
4343,Don't know - Brilliant Walk in Emergency A & E - I attended on Sat afternoon it was busy with many injured or Ill people but 3 hours later hobbled out on crutches after seeing 2 very experienced and brilliant nurses and having had an Xray. They cleaned up my cut and stitched me up excellent service I will return but not too often I hope.
745,Arrived at 11:40pm with chest pains and palpitations got seen quite quickly and had an ECG. My HR had dropped so they decided I didn't need a cubicle and told me to back to the waiting area. It's now 4:30am I have been experiencing bad chest pains and notified the navigator over 2 hours ago but still nothing. There's no new people coming in but there's so many of us who have been sat for hours with no sign of movement. No one seems to care!!! This is the worst service I've experienced here...doesn't help that I'm alone and scared. I want to walk out and go to bed but what about my pains?! ?! Shocking. Some have been here 6hours and still nothing.

6362,"Mental Health Services/ Psychiatry - I was recently assigned a new consultant psychiatrist after suffering from bipolar, severe depression and historic suicide attempts. After many years of being passed to different consultants at each appointment I never really felt I wasn't being listened to, perhaps due to the fact I had a different consultant at each appointment, I completely understand the need for this and how short staffed the NHS mental health team are so it is an no fault to the consultants or NHS themselves. My new consultant psychiatrist has changed my life, she has watched me come from one of my lowest points and help transform me into a stable human being again. Her support is second to none and there is not one thing she cannot or will not do for you, without her I would not be the stable woman I am today. When I say she has given me the support, care and upmost respect it would be an understatement. Her abilities as a consultant psychiatrist are in my opinion second to none and I wish there was something I could do to thank her for saving my life. I would just like to extend my deepest gratitude to the NHS Isle of Wight Mental Health Team and my psychiatrist."
4106,"Nobody wants to visit hospital, let alone be treated, but the sense of calm, efficient and professional service the Horton provides makes it my first choice every time. Thank you to all the wonderful staff from the receptionist, consultant, nurses, plaster room technicians, to the physio whose care I've been released into, thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you've done and are doing to care for me.

8087,"Just signed up to @30DaysWild Looking forward to it already, whatever lockdown brings. Last year I spent each of the 30 days visiting my elderly mum who was really poorly in hospital. The little effort to take a moment and record a snapshot of nature each day really helped me."
1572,"Really grateful to the #neurology clinic @GSTTnhs who were brilliantly helpful - & quick - when I needed to change an appointment. Really appreciated, especially during this incredibly pressured & difficult time for the hospitals."
4056,There was a 90 minute delay which is fine but nobody told you about it on check in which is unhelpful.
5058,Nothing better. I turned up was scanned within 5 minutes and 15 minutes later left the Hospital. Long live Saturday appointments. If I could have voted 5 star I would. The corridor Art Gallery appears to be controlled by one person. Not very opportunistic for other Artists.
5353,Patient in the Entencive care waiting from 6 hours to 12 hours to see the doctor and I don't no what's important meeting for doctors more than one hour or the patient But the only good thing in this hospital is the nursing
7473,"Great Telephone Service - I was greatly helped by the telephone counselling I received via Mindsmatter self referral. After each call I felt I had made a huge amount of progress. The contact I had made me feel stronger, more confident and validated my feelings. It was as if it was ok not to feel ok - which allows you the space to become ok! "

4048,"A big thank you to all the staff at Doncaster Royal Infirmary especially the Critical Care and COVID19 Ward nurses and doctors. It has been a difficult week for us, but, our daughter Carolyn has now been discharged and is completing her recovery at home. Please stay everyone."
9768,The organisation of Outpatients 10 was excellent. There was no hanging around and if it took a little time to see the doctor at the end then there was the tennis to watch.
2739,just got out from being ran over and as i crossed the road an ambulance ran me over again. had to be rushed back into hospital. NOT HAPPY GUYS
9479,"Ophthalmology - How is one meant to have an eye examination over the phone? - I have a daughter who is severely disabled, she cannot communicate in any manner, unable to use her hands in a meaningful manner, nor follow any commands given. As a parent, I have no idea if she has any vision problems or pain in the eye. She has to come in for a physical examination and even that is very very tricky as she doesn't look directly at the consultant's torch. So you can imagine my frustration when I received an appointment letter telling me that my appointment (which has been postponed since first lockdown) will now be a telephone consultation. How on earth is a consultant meant to examine my daughter over the telephone? She certainly won't be looking at a computer screen, and I certainly don't know what she can or cannot see. I should hope the consultants are fully aware of my daughter's condition before sending out such a pointless appointment letter. I also received a pre registration form sent which I'm meant to hand over to the receptionist at the clinic. Well if it's a telephone appointment, how do I hand in a form? And why should I be filling in this form if my daughter has been attending this hospital for good few years. Such a waste of printing paper and incompetance of the team. "
1844,"Accident and emergency services - A big thank you for very good care - My mother, aged 81 with Parkinson's Disease had a fall on the evening of Tuesday 17th December, we rushed to the A&E department at the Queen Elizabeth hospital. There was a large laceration to her head so she needed a CT scan and stitches. The doctor who dealt with our case deserves praise for his efficiency and kindness and the team was excellent. We would just like to say a big thank you."

5984,Staff excellent shame about the member of public with his face mask not even covering his nose polite word soon cured that have more respect for nhs staff
345,Vascular surgery - 7/10 could do better - Not a good experience at all. Told there would be no pain apart from local anaesthetic but the whole procedure was painful. Was not told or given advice of what i can and cant do on discharge from hospital. Printers didnt work so was not given a discharge letter. Not told how long i have to take my new medication for. One positive thing was the food was lovely and the lady that came round with the tea and coffee was so nice. Nurses were pleasent aswell. 
5741,"Because its quick, professional and friendly."
7200,"If ever you are told you are being referred to the QEQM, ask yourself a question, 'is there ANY remote chance they are going to be able to help me' then remember this answer'NO! ' You would be safer asking the ambulance to rush you to ASDA and deposit you on a checkout conveyer belt where you can be checked out by a Till Operator, his or her'best guess' would be more diagnostically accurate than the not fit for purpose staff at a not fit for purpose facility called the QEQM. This Hospital was in Special Measures for five years and is still banned from performing certain surgical procedures. The Hospitals in Mogadishu are more up to date than this relic which seems to have been transported by a time machine from a very poor former Soviet Bloc Village near Pripyat!! English is a third or fourth language for most Registrars which is just what you need when trying to relay and receive life saving information!! If you are lucky enough to survive your visit and not come out with a dose of MRSA or Bed Sores then you may collect a'I survived the QEQM Coffee Mug from the crowd of clappers outside.who are wearing T Shirts with the same logo on them. Don't worry about Ambulances running you over, they are under strict instruction to transfer 999 patients to QEQM at no faster than 8 miles per hour, or until patient has literally died. The Helipad is just for show, no one gets lifted from QEQM to a decent Hospital as they are already deceased."

9742,"Antenatal Experience - My wife and I attended a 20 week anomaly¬†scan in January 2020, Our appointment was booked for 4:30pm and we were advised to be there 15 minutes before the time of the appointment. Both of us work full time, my wife for a small family business who made arrangements for her post to be covered and myself for a busy business in Bristol, again who made cover arrangements for us to attend the appointment. We arrived at the hospital at 3:45pm allowing good time for the appointment and it was a good job we did as we then spent 45 minutes stuck in what can only be described as a car park traffic jam. Trapped in a confined concrete tower and being forced to breathe in copious fumes from car exhausts¬†and burning clutches, which is obviously bad for a pregnant woman... We managed to arrived at a busy antenatal¬†department over 15 minutes early for our appointment but did not get into the Sonograph room until after the appointment time. The staff were very good but our baby did not want to entertain them and as 5pm was fast approaching it was made clear we would have to re-book to complete the scan as the department was closing at 5pm and they were not willing to wait for the baby to move. I don'[t understand why you would book appointments for this time frame where any over runs will mean the last patients of the day needing to re-book. Getting through taunton during working hours and getting time off work is already difficult enough without having to re-book! The Sonography assured me we would be able to re-book for a Saturday... We we're then told we would have to call the following day to re-book during open hours... The next appointment they could give us was an early morning appointment 2 weeks later on the same day we had a late afternoon consultancy appointment, advising they no longer do Saturdays! after several calls they refused to re-schedule either of the appointments unless it was for several weeks after this date! My Advice, don't accept late afternoon appointments as there are no allowances and be prepared for the eye watering parking charges! "
3288,"QE hospital - amazing - Brilliant staff and great care, had a longer than expected stay on ward 11 at the QE and couldn't be happier with the care from the staff. So friendly and did everything to make a difficult time as easy as possible. Just wanted to say a short thank you to everyone"
3949,"Accident and emergency services - Superb staff - Referred to Wexham Park hospital's A and E department by my GP following a positive Covid diagnosis that then developed into Long-Covid. Spent 5-6 hours in A and E having variety of tests. Every member of the medical team was helpful, professional and empathetic. Nothing was too much for them. Seen twice by a medical doctor then by a Respiratory Consultant. The information provided by the consultant was reassuring and really helped me to understand what to expect from Long-Covid and how to deal with it. I have lived in Slough for over 60 years and my family has had some very negative experiences in A and E. The new department was faultless. My husband had been admitted to a ward via A and E with Covid a week earlier, and he also said the treatment he received in A and E was fantastic. "

2385,Competence
95,"General Medicine - Outstanding support and professionalism - Following a fracture to my foot I attended A& E Department and subsequently the Fracture Clinic, Diagnostic and Imaging Department and the Physiotherapy Department over an eight week period. Throughout my treatment, all the hospital staff were extremely kind and compassionate and worked together as a team to deliver first class care to me. In an extremely busy fracture clinic a nurse kept us all informed so we understood that there were 46 patients for just two consultants. In spite of a busy clinic the consultant made time to give me a referral to the physiotherapy department where a kind and approachable young male physiotherapist gave me practical assistance and built my confidence in using the crutches and zimmer frame. My urgent CT scan report was fast-tracked by the radiographer who undertook to speak to the senior radiographer the following day. She also gave me the consultant's secretary's contact number so I could check receipt of the CT scan report and make an appointment with her. When I telephoned her I was impressed with her understanding and efficiency. She fitted me into an already busy clinic on the following day. The female nurse who removed my cast was not only extremely competent but showed real empathy, understanding the frustrations and difficulties, having been in a similar situation. I was acknowledged personally on arriving and leaving the consultant's clinic by the reception nurse and the nurse assisting the consultant that day introduced herself to me and kindly manoeuvred my wheelchair into the consulting room. The appointments' clerk was exceptionally helpful in rearranging my follow-up appointment. His telephone manner was warm and reassuring. He took time to listen and made a decision based on the situation rather than just taking the easy option. I am also indebted to the hospital's pharmacy staff whom I rang on two occasions with two separate issues about the prescribed injection. Both pharmacists were extremely helpful: on the first occasion I spoke to a male pharmacist who made enquiries and rang me back with the information. On the second occasion I spoke to female who gave me practical advice on the administration of the injection and I felt comforted to talk to someone who fully empathised with me as she had been through a similar experience. At a time when there are increasing pressures on staff working in the NHS I am extremely appreciative of the excellent care and compassion I have received from all the staff at Airedale Hospital over the eight week period as well as from the Community Services nurse who was sent to visit me. All these staff treated me as an individual rather than just another patient. They lived the Trust's patient-centred care delivery values and worked as a team to deliver those to me. "

7085,"Incredibly rude staff - Everytime I have been to the Ivy Centre at st.leonards the reception staff have been unbelievably rude. They snap at you, patronise you, and have no basic manners. At today's appointment at 9:00 I rang the bell at 8:56 to be barked at that I'd have to wait because there's no one in. They also called me by the wrong name at least twice, which doesn't fill me with confidence. On previous occasions they've been sarcastic, snarky and downright insulting. This isn't the type of behaviour you expect from professionals in the industry "

The surgery' for my brother was required to reconstruct his jaw after the damage caused by radiotherapy following cancer treatment. He has had to prepare himself physically and mentally for several months during which time the pain has been unbearable. I want to say a massive thank you to everyone involved with his case, he had every faith in his consultant from the start, and I am so relieved that the surgery went ahead as scheduled and was a success and he is now in ICU recovering for several days. The surgeons and theatre staff are my heroes as are the nursing staff. thank you for all that you do."

Even though we are in the middle of the Coronavirus emergency, the referral pathway from my GP worked smoothly and quickly. When I arrived at the clinic, the waiting room was set up according to social distancing measures and all staff were wearing protective gear. I felt protected and I hope they did too. The consultant was very kind and explained what would happen. I had a mammogram and an ultrasound scan, both of which were very comfortable and done with care and compassion. All staff were very friendly and it all felt very ‚Äúnormal‚Äù - unlike practically everything else at the moment! I received my results after the imaging (fortunately benign), spoke again to the consultant and was discharged. I know people are feeling concerned about visiting their GP or hospital and perhaps trying ‚Äúignore‚Äù potentially serious health symptoms like mine but don't! I was never made to feel like I was inconveniencing health staff, my problem was taken very seriously and I was treated with care and compassion throughout. We are so lucky to have this fantastic health service with all its brilliant staff! "
1280,It was a telephone consultation. It would have been better if in person but I guess it's difficult at the moment

8582,"Just before lockdown 28/03/20 I gave birth to my son in Wallingford midwifery. I had a waterbirth and an amazing experience. The midwife Stacey and nurses were so kind and caring. Stacey reassured me my body would know what to do and she would keep an eye on things, so I could deliver without worrying. It was such a calm friendly environment. Couldn't wish a better place for my little one to enter the world. Can't thank you all enough! "
435,"Friendly, fast and efficient."
3263,"If you want to live avoid this hospital. Middleton ward this week have abused patients. Refusing pain relief, purposely starving a young person that ended up having Renal failure."
366,The rudeness from some of the staff at Barnsley Hospital is horrendous! Why be there if you don't want to do your job??? 
8901,Miss Smith has just delivered the Science departments safety glasses and gloves to community nurses to help out wth their shortage of PPE. They were really grateful and we were more than happy to help out. üòÉ#keyworkers @StockportNHS #sharingiscaring #EveryLittleHelps
6934,"An appointment was booked for a telephone consultation, which had been arranged promptly following my doctor's referral, with Ailis Hayes who contacted at the prearranged time and conducted a very comprehensive review of my case. Despite the obvious draw backs of having to have the consultation by telephone rather than face to face I felt Ailis's handleing of the appointment was excellent and very thorough."
2843,"Amazing practical BLS session delivered by Sarah B via LifeSize @Moorfields Northwick Park today, keeping us compliant. Thank you. #NewWaysofWorking"
2944,"The long wait - 5 hours, sitting close to a young couple not wearing masks and constantly swearing. However the Consultant we saw was delightful, thorough, patient and professional. He was excellent. If my score was based on his input it would be 1"
3144,Reception was polite [4es] | The wait was rather long in total 8.5 hours [2fa]. Got there and had to stand which was agonising [1a]. Quite a few couples were allowed to stay together which were different ethnicity to me. One did get asked to leave but once night staff came on he came back. Not fair to allow 2 people in when there's elderly waiting alone and the waiting room was busy and there taking up a seat for somebody what genuinely needs it. Also I saw a member of staff challenge a young girl over a mask but they were several others in the waiting area without one [1a]. Should be all or nothing. Still didn't get an xray after all that time and been told if no better to come back. I admire the NHS and I understand very understaffed and they were no beds and also half of the people in there if they could of been seen by there own gp wouldn't of needed to be sat there.
3874,if it wasnt for this hospital and the staff I wouldn't have my husband he had a double lung transplant a few weeks ago and now I have him here with me and his children other wise he wouldn't have been here now thankyou to you all our family is still a whole because of you ‚ù§

4572,"Check your appointment text message! - I've just got back from the Tissue Viability clinic at St Charles where I had gone for a 14:30 appointment to have my dressings changed. The reason I say 14;30 is because that was when the nurse who did the previous session told me it was. It turns out that the all-seeing, all-knowing computer system thought that it was an 11:30 appointment. Thus it was that I was patronized to within an inch of my life, by a senior member of staff, who was intensely rude to me and then when I expressed discomfort at this treatment, actually called the security staff on me. It was only when a junior member of the nursing team appeared, and apologized profusely, and conceded that maybe there was a possibility that the error was not of my making, that I was able to calm down. This is not the first time that the aforesaid senior member of staff has managed to make me feel 2 inches tall. Previous encounters have involved this person attributing some perceived failure of mine to carry out instructions relating to leg-care somehow being down to a lack of moral fibre on my part! I know the NHS are under immense pressure and I support them completely, but I do not need this type of nonsense. So, to sum up, if you are told one thing and the text-message says another thing, then it's probably best, for the sake of your mental health, to go with the text message..."
5224,big thank you to doctor and staff and all the midwife team although the whole experiance was traumatic at first we were looked after well and got the best care i am so happy environment very private and calm. i felt at ease and despite not being able to stay over i felt baby was safe and looked after i loved the video app. It would be great to have a thank you tree / board enabling parents to really say thank you / share comments
6638,"This hospital was convinced my mom was okay, and told us that after 7 HOURS. 2 days later, she was in a different A and E, because she couldn't breathe properly. They told her it was just her medicine taking effect, while the other A and E in an ambulance, said she had a lot of infection in her lungs. That kind of thing doesn't develop two days."

8695,Maternity services - Pointless waiting for policy for scans - What is the actual point in making partners wait in a seperate waiting room for scans. Why make a emotional time even worse by giving the worry they may miss the scan because phone signal drops out. Wonderful to sit here watching everyother tom dick and Harry go into maternity (some without a mask) while you sit here hoping you don't miss a very important life event. Cheers GHE.

1002,"Very unproffesional staff in the maternity ward, been here twice the first time was hectic. They ddnt know what they were doing we stayed for way longer than we needed doing unnessasary blood tests making my wife even more week. All the x-ray machines were not working so we had to wait even longer while my wifes in severe pain. This time very rude midwives telling my wife not to scream as shes giving birth telling her to stop screaming and very rude. Swearing in the background and also male doctor came in when we specificly told them no males for religious reasons and yet they barged in with no respect for our privacy. The nurses knew this yet they did not inform the doctors this and did not say anythimg when it happend i had to tell them myself. Useless and no manners at all. I would avoid coming here again."
6411,"Fantastic, brilliant, amazing, can't thank the staff at Pembury hospital enough, my partner recently gave birth at Pembury, from early pregnancy through to emergency delivery via Cesarian we received the best care and professionalism. I have said suggested before the notion that each hospital has its own online 'tip box', where the general public can make donations that can there be shared out between nurses and staff weekly or monthly. To avoid arguments over anyone working longer hours just divide the pot by 2/3 rds 1/3rd, the larger amount going to full time and the remaining third going to part time employees. This may not be perfect but it is a lot better than the governments paltry offer. I am convinced the general public given their sense of general fair play and decency would be in favour of this. Of course if the likes of Jeremy Vine gets his hands on this it will have no hope of getting off the ground because he is the devils advocate and in fact when somebody else also mentioned on his radio 2 show he took no notice whatsoever, is a farce of rhetoric, hopelessness and despair. Lack of Social and economic justice are hugely damaging to society and most people have had enough of it. Thanks again to Hospital and staff for our beautiful baby girl, Pearl Ava May, gorgeous."
1657,"Recently spent 5 days in @MKHospital having fractured a hip in a cycling accident. After inevitable wait in A&E, when taken medical staff were attentive, and care received from all staff in theatre and orthopaedic ward 23 was excellent. Well done @MKHospital and thank you üëèüëèüëè"

Every team member introduced themselves, all procedures were explained carefully and I was kept consistently updated throughout my visit. At a time when I was scared and alone, the team were a beacon of humanity and care. I felt nurtured, heard and cared for. Thank you all for you all you do."

Taking time to go over the diagnosis clearly and treatment options. He is great with his patients and spends as much time as needed with you to get all questions answered and also just to get to know you. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for a specialist.

4951,"Accident and emergency services - Recovery Was reversed by lack of quality of care received - I attended PAH A&E on the evening of December 2nd. After a scan I was diagnosed with a Double Shoulder Fracture. I was called over by a nurse so she could fit a Sling. However, as I stood up I got very dizzy & started seeing spots so explained that & sat back down to which she responded ‚ÄúIf you want the sling you have to come here now, I have other patients‚Äù. I did therefore walk over there. As she was trying to fit the sling she mentioned about my stained trousers and said ‚ÄúYou should change your clothes before you come here‚Äù. I had already explained that I had been in an accident and knocked to the ground so will have mud stains on my trousers. I feel it is unreasonable to expect me to change my clothes before coming to the Hospital. The sling instantly felt painful & uncomfortable so I asked another Nurse if it was fitted properly & she stated ‚ÄúThere are other staff to ask‚Äù. Maybe so but I was asking her. I was therefore sent home with a sling that caused me pain as well as no painkillers that I asked for. I therefore spent the remainder of the week in pain due to the sling & the lack of painkillers. I then returned the following Monday & was eventually given the correct sling & painkillers that worked. However, I feel my recovery was reversed that first week due to what I feel was a failure by your A&E Dept to provide what I needed to self-care at home."
2917,"Really efficient, friendly and took the time to listen to my concerns. From reception through to the doctor it was great"
142,I had a phone consultation it was at the correct time and it saved me taking time off work
5569,1 doctors and nurses could not fault them. | From start to finish treatment was great.
2210,The staff at @RotherhamNHS_FT were amazing at 3am this morning! Our 1 year old daughter was struggling to breath / choking and was rushed in. All the staff that helped us were incredible and she's now doing well! Two very relieved parents!! 
333,Looked after me back in Jan 2020 always someone on hand to help
6787,Very disappointing in the bedside manner and the professional service in being spoken to like you're not there I had a confirmed case of pleurisy but the way the staff speak to you in the isolation unit at Russells Hall is totally unacceptable .Don't get me wrong the diagnosis was quick as follows 1. The room had not been cleaned before last used. There where used cups and gloves and masks on the floor with used 12 lead pads on the floor 2. The head of the nursing staff spoke to me with total dismissal 3 One of the doctors from A and E even spoke to the head nurse on my behalf to make a complaint sadly nothing changed 4. Look at the film footage from the old south Staff hospital. This is history repeating it self with no lessons learned
5497,The service I have received at Royal Surrey has always been excellent
7571,"I would like to extend my thanks - Please give my thanks to every member of staff for the care, help and kindness I received during my recent three night stay in the Freeman Room.

Please thank everyone I encountered who have helped set me on the path to recovery. Margaret Hallett"
7594,The staff go above and beyond to look after you while in hospital.
5514,"Gynaecology - excellent experience - Visited the Grace centre today, found it welcoming, relaxing, spotless, the staff were wonderful and friendly and the procedure was completed efficiently and expertly, showing great concern for my comfort during procedure, upon arrival I was told I would be next and had hardly sat down when called. Was worried about visiting hospital due to self isolating because of underlying health issues but the areas I went through were clean, and everyone was brilliant at social distancing. Overall a very good visit. Have to say everytime i've visited Musgrove I have never had a complaint, all the staff are wonderful, thank you."
3354,Very fast service. Excellent staff.
8762,"Awful experience - ER only I went to the emergency department with my mum, whose health condition was severe. We were received by a receptionist who yelled at us Wait there, no one has called you We then had to wait around 3 hours before being called. I did it outside with other patients as the room was full. Meanwhile, a lady with a 2 year old fainted not being able to wait more. My mum was then called to be told it was just an allergy. They gave her a ripped piece of paper which is not more than 7 centimetres long with the names of two medicines. 2 days later my mother fell unconscious with severe anaphylaxis. All l am going to say is that everyone should do what they enjoy and are enthusiastic about. Especially in a hospital, if they can't really be bothered to care and support patients they shouldn't be there at all. If things are done, they should be done properly. I understand that they work very hard, that they could be having a bad day and that they treat 100s of patients everyday, but we are talking about lives aren't we? 2 things no one can fool you about are interest and enthusiasm. The ridiculous piece of paper gave it all away. My mum didn't get any blood test done or anything at all and consequently she almost passes away 2 days later. I hope right people get to the right place. The ER should be a serious place to get advice from, not a circus."

Unable to handle very straight forward queries and relies on patients chasing and chasing to follow up. Feel fortunate my condition is not urgent. Frustrating to see their incompetence having a knock on impact on other departments and overstretched NHS staff who then have to pick up the slack. 
2035,Terrible experience @ their pharmacy! Barbaric waiting time for a prescription and they kept displaying on the screen other ticket numbers coming after mine. When I told them I've been waiting for more than one hour and a half and my three year old daughter couldn't take it any longer I've been asked to step outside & wait for my number to be called.

8472,"The exceptional care I received from Russell's Hall hospital - I wanted to share my feedback of the exceptional care, support and attention which my newly born daughter and I received during my visit to Russell's Hall in October 2019. The care, support and attention I received was outstanding for myself and my new-born daughter. From the moment we came into hospital, through the labour process itself to the after birth care I received was just exceptional. The ladies who work in the MLU and the Delivery Suite work so hard to ensure each individual who attends the hospital has the best possible experience even when individual cases are difficult. As I had an infection, I had to stay in hospital for 5 nights with my daughter which wasn't what I had hoped for as like every new mum they would want to be at home. However, it was such a positive experience and one which made me realise how dedicated these ladies in this hospital really are with every patient. The advice I was given was exceptional and at each step along the way of my new motherhood journey was supported and cared for by each of the ladies. I wanted to thank all the ladies in Russell's Hall hospital maternity unit for everything they did to support and care for me - this has given me such belief and trust in the service and I will always be very grateful. All of these individuals deserve the recognition and thanks for their hard work and commitment to their care and kindness in what they do each day - thank you for everything. Best wishes"

1428,"Skilled and caring - Many thanks to the First Responder/ Paramedic and the subsequent ambulance crew who attended to my wife who had fallen at the top of Langley Lane, Baildon on 04/03/21. The paramedic arrived quickly. He checked her and diagnosed that she had broken her wrist as well as the obvious head and face injuries. He could find no other injuries so he deemed it safe to put her into a sitting position. It was a cold, wet and miserable day so he supplemented the waterproofs and coverings supplied by kind neighbours with more blankets whilst we waited for the ambulance. It seemed like a long time, waiting in the cold and rain but it was probably only about half an hour before the ambulance, from Bradford, arrived. The two ambulance technicians loaded her carefully into the ambulance to take her to B.R.I. for further treatment. Again, I would like to thank everyone concerned for all the care given. "

2722,I do not wish to put anything in writing.
7657,"If I could give 0 stars i would. The maternity unit is absolutely attrocious. I'm sure there are midwife's who are an exception however both births I had there within a 4 year period, were handled terribly. After complaining it resulted in nothing however I later found out the midwife who caused us a great deal of trauma was disbarred. I'm glad she will not be able to ruin things for future mother's. I have attended the a&e department and again the staff are careless, not compassionate and unwilling to help. It's not about waiting times, waiting times are long in all local hospitals, it's the sitting around doing nothing, talking and joking with other staff when patients are clearly piling up and complete lack of representation of what our NHS is supposed to stand for. I overheard the registrar telling my doctor to hurry up and give my medication and discharge me so they wouldn't have to handover to the next shift... No matter how many unfortunate times I have had to attend there, it has never felt like there is a duty of care or admission of fault. Don't waste your time or put the care of yourself or your loved ones in the hands of this hospital... They need to be urgently reviewed."
8193,"the level of care we received was really good, "

From reception, the nurse the care was good. I went in to be examined further there was this gentle man who I later found out in the morning that he was the best consultant at king George hospital unfortunately I can't remember his name. I have lived here for years, I have never come across a consultant who loves his job like this gentleman. He is very caring, very down to earth, he kept reassuring me he even accompanied me to have a scan wow, normally your sent to have a scan year wheeled there and that is it.

3324,Acute Internal Medicine - Ward 1B a world away from 5 star - Our GP asked to attend 1B at 9am on the 10/8/21. She assured us that all my 91 year old mums details would be sent over. On arrival the reception desk was unmanned eventually a surly woman approached us asking why we were here. Having explained we'd been referred by our GP she said she'd need to check the diary. She returned to say mum was having a blood test. I questioned this as the GP could have done this easily and I thought see must being seeing a Dr. She responded that all the Drs were in handover and we'd need to go to the waiting gesticulating down a corridor. We found our way into the dimly lit for bay and took a seat. After 40 mins a young women I'm guessing a health care assistant as virtually all staff had their ID badges obscured. She took us into an adjacent ward with some in patients in beds. One area had the chairs used for taking blood. She took mums blood and explained it could be up to an hour before the results would come back. An ECG had also been requested and once that'd been done she would see a Dr. We returned to the waiting room. I wonder at the covid safety on numerous people being taken into the same bay as inpatients. We waited a further hour and forty minutes. Concerned that my mum had been sat for a considerable time in her wheel chair and due to the early start hadn't had breakfast I went to seek an update. Having given her name I was told they were waiting for blood results and an ECG this wasn't an update but a statement of facts I already knew. I explained my concerns and they brought some sandwiches. We had been given a cup of tea earlier by the catering team member. Mum ate her sandwich a short while later a Dr called mums name after a couple of failed attempts to find a place to sit with us we were asked to wait at the end of a corridor. He gesticulated to come to him passing the lunch trolley that was being unloaded. He sat us down and asked why had we come today. I explained that our GP had referred us. He was surprised as he thought we were a returning patient. He had no notes whatsoever for my mum. We explained the incident and showed ECG from the paramedics. He briefly looked at them before handing them back. He examined mum and then said the ECG was important and he'd check how long it was since mum had seen a cardiologist. I said it was over 4 yrs. we returned to the waiting room. Just after midday 3 hours after arrival they took the first obs of my mum. They said everything was fine The machine showed 172/80 when challenged she said it was a little high. She suggested we go to the ECG department as that may be quicker. We did as asked and returned just after 12.40. Handed it to staff. Just before 1pm the Dr came said we could leave and an Echo Cardiogram and 24 ECG. No mention of seeing a cardiologist. We quickly received a call for the cardiogram but they had no request for a 24 hour ECG. This isn't ‚Äúhigh quality..well organised..best practice..provides best possible experience‚Äù stated in 2021-22 objectives
2309,"I have just been discharged from ward 11.

I wasn't checked on the whole 12 hours I was sitting and waiting for no.1 checked to see if I had taken my medication, Or even if I had been offered a evening meal. It got to 10pm and I decided I was just going to go home. I was then told they had changed their mind on how they was going to induce me (I was never informed) but I still decided to go home. I usually have nothing but nice things to say about all the baby units in the hospital but this was an awful experience, I could have died in my bed and no.1 would have noticed as no.1 actually came to see if I was ok or needed anything."

She sent me to King George A and E where they didn't have any nurses at all! All this while I had a 3 month old baby in the car.

1017,"Urgent Treatment Centre - Excellent treatment - In the last 24 days I have had reason to call on the services at Urgent Care, and Outpatients at Skegness Hospital. On both occaisions the medical staff and administration staff were polite, conscientious, helpfull and caring. The treatment we received was excellent. Well done Skegness Hospital and the NHS."
7781,"Cardiology - NHS at its best - Being admitted after suffering fainting fits dizziness and low heart rate of 29 (after GP Surgery impossible to get into despite my serious conditions) I was dealt with quickly, professionally and with compassion. My stay in hospital was comfortable and a pleasant experience in the circumstances. From A &E to the MDU unit and finally cardiology I was treated extremely well indeed. Although I had an operation to have a pacemaker fitted, during that operation I felt comfortable and reassured and that was down to the fact that the professionals involved. Although they remained professional they also chatted and kept the atmosphere calm throughout . This certainly helped me feel calm. I am indebted to the professionalism of the staff at the hospital and would recommend the cardiology department at the drop of a hat. Thank you all- and a mere thank you does not do you justice."
3738,Taking Max home 15/2/21 Thankyou @gloshospitals and the Midwives on the Birth Unit for the care shown my Wife @StephHelen2186 and our new son. https://t.co/AQnZBUy3WJ
6831,Every thing went really well. I did not have to wait. All was social distanced. Angela tool my scan really well It was new equipment. Dr. Kirmani was very helpful. He explained that I had a slow growing cataract. But it didnt need any treatment for quite some time. It was all very pleasant and efficient. Thank you
7,Professor Bo Povlsen and the London Hand Clinic were fantastic! I was treated rapidly and effectively for stubborn and painful De Quervain's tenosynovitis brought on by pregnancy. Professor Bo Povlsen really took his time with me to go through everything and went out of his way to arrange fast treatment to resolve the condition. I would thoroughly recommend them.
1877,Staff are amazing and helpful everything was good staff are amazing friendly always willing to explain everything and help with anything i can not think of anything that could be done bettet
2164,Thanks you to @LG_NHS got to see e n t appointment today on a Sunday nhs are going above and beyond to see everyone x
9815,"Look after you well, great staff"
2126,"Rude operators. Three phone calls to them, and each one rude and abrupt. I'm a GP receptionist and can see why we get a bad name with people like that answering the phone. I'd never dream of being so ignorant towards patients."
5859,"I was always treated with respect. Nurses and Doctors are really great professionals, kind, friendly and very helpful . I go there regularly for more than 3 years and I never saw any incident with patients regarding the way they have been treated."
5484,1 Thank you.

5778,Accident and emergency services - Wonderful care - I had a bleed that started at 2.00 am and would not stop.This was following a dental procedure several days previously. I went to A&E at about 4.00 am and was met with great kindness and professionalism by the reception and the medical staff. I was referred on to Royal London by ambulance where I was seen by a dental professional who found that the Whipps Cross staff had done the right thing and the bleeding had stopped. I then went to my dentist who removed my sutures and cauterised a vein that he thought had caused the problem. I am very grateful to the A&E staff at Whipps Cross for the care I received at a time of day when other alternatives were not available.
5559,"Only problem is the parking. Very stressful on what is already a very stressful day.  The Consultant and nurses who we met were very understanding and pleasant on what was a very difficult day. Facilities were very good. Only downside, as i have already said, is the car parking which was a nightmare and very stressful."
8740,Thanks to all @PCHBreastUnit for your care today. Even with the pressures of COVID the service was still run with a smile and I felt like I was in safe hands #ThankYouNHS @NWAngliaFT
5020,3 RT visits so far. Staff very polite and professional.
2221,"Not being from Hereford, I had to go to the A&E on Thursday the 5 August with a dislocated shoulder. The staff very pleasant and caring, but the organisation was appalling, their Triage system doesn't work and there was no joined up communication. The pain from a dislocated shoulder is excruciating, being given paracetamol is a joke, but another way to delay treatment. After some considerable time they gave me morphine, which did not control the pain, their answers to the nil affect of this drug, was let's wait another hour or two. I was nearly six hour in the A&E in extreme pain, you might think they were busy, they weren't. Sadly all the good work nurses and Doctors do is eroded by the poor organisation."

6879,Everyone really kind and helpful.
5858,"I would like to once again thank everyone at @RBandH for excellent care, kindness and expertise. They also had so much more extra work to do in protecting us patients from COVID-19. Thank God for our NHS, which has saved my life many times. https://t.co / iCGk31rJCG"
8851,Worse experience I every had . The receptionist was amazing Attentive and. Helpful.. The sister that took my blood was dam right rude and aggressive not very caring... Then the wait well advised 4 hour wait . Arrived at 11pm walked out at 05am with out seeing a doctor was left in pain and. A burst lump no one even looked at it completely outrages
7582,"Staff made it very safe, pleasant and professional."
2987,Thank you so much @LancsHospPaeds and @prestonnicu you are both amazing and I am very lucky to work with such fantastic teams.
7162,The staff are very helpful and friendly and made you feel at home
52,"I came in today 10/11/21 the staff are so lovely, in and out of theater, thank you to Dr's who have helped with my pain xx"
1247,Arrived at A&E at 9:45 and was seen within an hour or so. The doctor who checked over my toe was brilliant and kind and after checking my toe ordered an X-ray to check i had managed to put it back into place it was all done within 15 mins was an overall excellent service.
237,very caring helpful staff but you hardly ever see a doctor and it takes ages for anything to happen also its cold
2299,Very grateful for thewonderful team at @WestMidHospital A&E who looked after my OH with Alzheimer's splendidly yesterday pm. So caring & professional. I was Covidscared going there. How brave to be there everyday.
8451,"Cardiology - Excellent care - Had pacemaker fitted 23/1 at QEQMH cardiac catheter unit.From admission to discharge my care was amazing. As a retired nurse I was very impressed. Although very nervous, the whole procedure was explained clearly. Thankyou you all very much "
4191,All the nurses were amazing all thru 2020 i have had stays rvery time they all really great
9582,"I had the misfortune of fracturing my hand today and I cannot praise the DGH A&E department enough. Even though it was very busy, I was seen and treated really swiftly. Every person that helped me, from the receptionist through to the X Ray team, were lovely. So thankful for our superb NHS! "

9751,Good hospital
6102,from the moment i arrive everyone i met could have not been more welcoming
970,Mr Kirmani and his staff were excellent as usual
4993,This is what all doctors surgeries and hospitals should be. I attended following on going investigation into my medical issues and found the staff on site to be really pleasant helping guide me to where i needed to go. The consultant saw me pretty soon and requested sample and blood tests which were carried out just down the hall. WHY cant all centre be like this instead of going away and waiting weeks for another appointment for the tests!!! If they were all this easy the NHS would save a great deal of time and money too! The hardest part was parking as there are not many bays so local street parking is advised. If that's the worst part then you can be sure medically you will feel looked after! 
3835,"Calm, quiet and efficient care at all times. Always willing to answers questions and provide good support."
952,"Personal shout out to CCU, MRI and #pharmacy staff @MusgrovePark Hospital for a high quality patient experience (and food, never forget the food!). These staff are absolute credit to the @NHSuk during these challenging timesüëèüëè"
817,"Car Parking - I needed to attend a pre-operation Covid-19 test three days prior to the operation. I attended Lincoln hospital and parked in the Main car park as I had not received any instructions on where to go with my pre-operation paperwork. On asking where to go at the enquiry desk I was directed to a door by oncology and told to ring a specific number. Fortunately I have a mobile phone as there is no phone available to use! I was then told I was in the wrong place and needed to drive round to the rear of the hospital and look for a blue tent! I eventually found a blue and white gazebo and had the test but was very stressed as I was technically late for the appointment. Why wasn't a little map included in the original paperwork which would save a lot of stress. Also, don't expect everyone to have a mobile phone"

7423,"Accident and emergency services - Responsive and sensible - Came to A&E as the only way to get urgent gynae procedure done. Triage was quick, friendly and competent. I was referred into the right department and off A&E register quickly and sensibly. No wasted hours in pain on a metal chair, thank you."
6841,"A superb experience. 3 days in after heart attack. Really excellent staff, they were excellent in every way. They had so many things to deal with and remained friendly, caring and professional. I take my hat off to them. The Tea ladies were lovely and the tea and food miles beyond expectations. Actually it was all way beyond expectations. Above all the nurses put in 100 percent effort to what they were doing and they deserve respect ."
9315,Bit of a wait to be treated Doctors and Nurses very well mannered and caring BIG THANK YOU ALL STAFF üò∑üëç
3505,Poor service.
4858,Excellent.
502,"I was looked after fantastically well and all the staff listened to me, particularly when I was anxious. Professor Ala is AMAZING."
7538,Diagnostic Endoscopy - Friendly Professional Caring Service - I would like to thank the staff in the Endoscopy unit where I attended on 27th Apr 2021. With all the difficulties and restrictions with Covid their kindness and caring professionalism shone through. Thank you so much for easing what was an anxious stressful time. 
6512,I think the Radiotherapy department is very well set up. Every part of the treatment is explained and all my questions answered. I found all the staff to be caring and understanding and I felt at ease and confident whenever I attended the department. Well done the whole team.
681,"Everybody was excellent and very thoughtful, professional and caring. Cannot fault the NHS."
9783,Undergoing update but still operating as normal. Pleasant and helpful staff.
7794,"Intensive Care - Excellent care delivered with kindness - I was brought in A&E with breathlessness (turned out to be PE). Very rapid diagnosis and treatment. Moved to EAU where I experienced a professional and friendly response from all staff, cleaners to consultants. Obviously everyone was very busy but dealt with all as human beings. Well done PRUH."

9230,"Thorough practice and caring staff - My daughter was admitted to ward 8 of RPH with jaundice. As she was at high risk of infections we were put into a side room. The room had a full bed for one parent to stay, and meals (albeit children's size as it was kids ward) were provided. This helped us a lot and eased worries we had about her having to stay in. The staff couldn't do enough for you. Our daughter had some breathing problems and the Dr treating her did lots of thorough checks, even arranging for her to attend an outpatient cardiac clinic at the hospital during her stay. The parents room was also much appreciated with tea and coffee facilities - our stay was made as comfortable as it could be."
9156,"Don't know - Accident and emergency department - I as unfortunate enough to have to go to A & E on 31st July 2021. I was working in thee garage at home and accidentally hit my head on a corner of a cupboard, t bled profusely and my immediately to me to A & E at Maidstone hospital. I entered via tented reception are where there was no information as to procedure, My Husband knocked on the door of the office and was greeted by a nurse, even though I was obviously still bleeding was told to take a seat when they were ready . We waited about half an hour and were then called . even though I was very unstable my Husband was not allowed to accompany me. I then went through the stages as required only to be told it was a 2 hour wait for treatment. I appreciate the Covid problems but felt this was totally unreasonable as I had a head injury. The treatment I finally received was very good but that does not make up for the treatment before hand. During this time my husband was waiting outside totally unaware as to what was happening. Your comments would be appreciated."
4519,"Very bad experience in Fleming ward The staff is very unprofessional They didn't care about baby They are just passing time, talking, chatting So so poor bad teribale experience Please don't took your baby to them"
4145,"Seen on time, no waiting, efficient. As always parking a concern."
6300,"Maternity services - Felt so cared for - I just wanted to write a thank you to the lovely maternity team at City hospital. I've just come home having been in for a couple days with contractions at 33 weeks and I really cannot fault the staff on labour suite and the ward I was on. To say we how much pressure our hospitals are under at present, I felt the care I recieved was no different. Baby is hopefully staying put for now but when I have to come back I am glad I chose this hospital. Thank you x"
1484,"Apart from waiting 8 hours in A&E ...once we reached an appointment with our 21 year old son, our experience at Wythenshaw Hospital was excellent. From first contact to being discharged following an emergency appendectomy, we cannot praise the staff and procedures more highly. Thank you all for this. All levels of staff were extremely caring and professional. From our own perspective the hospital seems well managed and very well presented, which gave us confidence, and despite all the expected difficulties of a very large NHS facility, we felt we received warm and personalised treatment throughout. . . Thank you all once again."
127,no time and looked after well.
5129,"From the reception to the nurse to the doctor, I have had a good experience. Very pleased with the nurse Alina and Mrs. Villanueva, and doctor Emma who were very helpful and showed empathy and care for my health situation. And also I had someone check up on me every few minutes to see if I am ok, or if i need coffee, water, or anything to eat. Lovely staff ü•∞"
6440,"General Surgery - Bad experience - My frail 96 year old husband was admitted to ward 18 at Arrowe Park after a severe nose bleed. Whilst on the ward he asked for a drink but this never arrived. There was no water at his bedside. He has one kidney and must not get dehydrated. Whilst in the ward he had a fall, despite being in the care of the nursing staff who had been warned that he was frail and unsteady on his feet. When he got home he was so thirsty he just kept asking for water. I am frankly horrified that basic human needs such as having water to drink were not being catered for. Surely this is the first thing that staff need to ensure is in place once a patient is on the ward. I am now very worried in case he needs to be admitted again . "
6101,"Why is my friend, who is never patient facing and works part time as an admin member of staff @YorkTeachingNHS getting her Covid vaccine next week, yet my mum who works 5 days a week in community pharmacy hasn't even had notice of how to book hers? @ValeofYorkCCG 1/2"
3187,"I go to the medical day care unit I am literally in and out they are so sweet and friendly its always a pleasure. Need to text people theyre appointments so that we can show the entrance staff when questioned to see our appointments, because mine is every month its arranged before I leave and I remember it."
3880,Very bad experience.. I arrived to A&E in the midnight with my 2 year old daughter because she was feeling ill and she was seen by a doctor to 7 am. I waited 7 hours there with a toddler.. I really dont know how that place can be called emergency when you have to wait 7 hours for being seen by a doctor..
6612,"Fall and broken ribs - I fell down stairs at home lay unconscious until next morning, ambulance crew fantastic and put me at ease. have mechanical aorta valve so lucky I didn't bleed out. 7 broken ribs 5 double so 12 breaks lung didn't look good at time nor did kidney. "
2327,Had 2 night stay on ward 17 after a serious bout of sickness wanted to say thank you to all the staff that took care of me excellent and staff where very caring.
1870,Your nurses were so kind and it was all so efficient - thank you
8102,My mother in law said it was like being privately looked after (she has never had that experience) but she felt well looked after...she thought the staff were friendly and looked after her very well. She felt safe and secure and cared about
1284,helpful and informative
2551,"Stroke - Empathetic Help and advice - I recently stayed with my dad each day for four days in Torbay hospital, after he had a catastrophic fall onto the pavement. He is 90 years old and had suffered concussion. One of his teeth had broken and split his lip apart and he was bruised all down one side - but the injury to his face was shocking. The staff were brilliant; patient and kind with me as well as him; they gave me advice and a pack for patient-carer support and put me in touch with the intermediate care team on our return home. I am so grateful to the staff, as we now have a commode and a bed handling device which have made things much easier for me at home. I've learnt a lot from their advice about chest infections and now have a propping up device for the bed as well, and I am feeling more confident. An assessment of his needs and a care package has been arranged for him and myself post hospital as well. Thank you so much to everyone; you obviously realised the strain of caring for him was taking its toll on me and I needed to feel much more connected up with services and community support. "
5041,I was seen immediately after a car accident today. Staff were all friendly and efficient. Not too long a wait for x-ray either. Excellent service
3586,fantastic treatment - i was admitted to the conquest hospital as an emergency on19th december as an emergency for an elbow replacement after an accident and discharged on25th december.I couldnt have had more kindness andhelp and also explanation than i had. nothing was too much trouble and although the staff must have been stressed because of corona they never showed it.my operation was successful and i am now having aftercare at the dgh which is proving very helpful.
3554,"My baby was born in this place, I felt so safe in here! All the nurses and doctors are super friendly and helpful! The hospital is clean and nice! Thank You!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
4214,"I Badly cut finger and went here, very covid safe and lovely staff, check in at reception and then wait in car till they ask you to return. The only criticism is parking, pay and display and cash only. No change machine so had to purchase something in shop to get change, they will not change notes for you. In the days of cash free this is not acceptable and also pay and display when you have no idea how long you will wait is unfair."
8978,No way of knowing how long the wait would be.
7555,We have had amazing care from PICU and Ward D34 and I cannot thank them enough for looking after our son so wellüòÄ
7915,Thanks to @YorksAmbulance yesterday for great response to my father aged 92 now having care at @HarrogateNHSFT.#NHS
6234,Thank you for the help with my very elderly Mother yesterday.
109,Serious now... just wanted to say I honestly feel so lucky to have worked alongside so many amazing people at @RoyalFreeNHS and @ImperialNHS this last year. I know the ‚Äúheroes‚Äù narrative is flawed... but you guys have been the silver lining on this festering cloud of a year. üíì
9517,"Respiratory Medicine - Fantastic care - Was admitted to A&E and processed and looked after v well and v quickly. Was on a corridor in A&E for 14 hours which was horrible but the staff who looked after me were v kind, professional and hard working. I was found a bed in ACU for 12 hours and again staff brilliant, thorough and reassuring. Finally transferred to respiratory ward for 3 days and all the nurses were caring, helpful, professional and hard working. It was a scary experience for me as diagnosed with pneumonia and couldn't get my oxygen levels up but the round the clock care and support really helped me stay strong and get better. "
6333,How can you call a ward million times and not to be able to get through at all... the visits are not allowed due to pandemic which is understandable but to not have nobody to pick up the phones when the family is really worried about the patient-lack of communication as the nurses and doctors don't pass the information to each other correctly/ one will say one story and another something completely different. Ward 411 please sort yourself some clerk who would be picking up the calls and take notes or if you promising that the nurse will call back the family keep the word!!! Below many not answered calls .. during the day
6545,"Don't know - Fantastic care - I arrived by ambulance with stomach pains with a very supportive team, I was taken straight to a room in A&E, where they got my pain under control, CT scan was done soon after, to discover I had appendicitis (complex as sited in hernia) I was moved to ward A700, where I spent 18 days of my 20 day stay. I cannot praise the hardworking staff enough, they supported me mentally & physically throughout my stay & subsequent surgery. Covid restrictions in place I wouldn't allow my designated family member to visit. I cant praise the staff enough, the verbal abuse they take from some patients is disgusting, yet they still care for those people with the respect that isnt reciprocated. Well done BRI. Sincere thanks to the teams of A700 & my short stay in C808."
8133,
6589,Have received treatment for eye conditions for close to a decade now. The staff have been caring and informative at every step of the journey.
556,1 very good | Every one was helpful I went straight in could no have been better.

4874,"Always go that extra mile for my disabled daughter. Caring, knowledgeable and very prompt."
5646,"After my superb care @MKHospital Wednesday, I had my op at Stoke Mandeville Hospital today. Tricky tendon work; delightful, caring team. So grateful to all those from across the globe who are our beautiful and precious NHS. THANK YOU. @KzpKaren - 6 weeks in plaster but sorted. x"
2240,"Dr. de Vos rang for my appointment owing to Coronavirus giving his usual excellent service, thank you ALL in these difficult times"
8501,Very busy place
7694,Dr came straight away to see my child. | No
7498,I was referred to have an X-ray on my thumb - I had the X-ray and was told to go to A and E to have a screw removed that was starting to push out from a plate at the base of my thumb I queued for about half an hour to get to the desk then was sent out to Springfield urgent treatment centre I checked in their and sent in to the waiting room where I waited for over two hours then when I was seen I was told I shouldn't have been sent their I should've been sent to the fracture clinic and sent home to wait for another appointment so still getting stabbed by this screw in my thumb.
9576,Chest X-Ray at Medway Hospital - With the current state of the Pandemic I was a little apprehensive about coming in to the Hospital. The staff on reception were very helpful and calm and professional. There was obvious cleaning of the waiting area going on which put my mind at rest. The staff in Xray were very good and I was dealt with swiftly and professionally. Please pass on my thanks to the Xray department and the guys at the main entrance.
4314,"Diagnostic Endoscopy - Great practice - I attended the Unit for gastroscopy and colonoscopy, experiencing excellent service and care from the team throughout, from the initial phone call, the pre assessment, the procedure itself plus recovery and discharge procedures, great team working well together. These procedures can be daunting normally but more so with the addition of coronavirus restrictions and rules, which required attending for a drive through Covid test at Airedale, ( very well organised and carried out) then a period of isolation, I felt well informed, supported and cared for. Especially appreciated was the post examination oral and written explanation of findings, information and support, very reassuring . Thanks to all concerned"
3708,The best birthday present I ever received was from @GreatOrmondSt when they released my daughter after open heart surgery 8 years ago today. Will ALWAYS be the best birthday present ever! 2/2
712,"I've never seen such chaos at a hospital! A and E department, and resus, a complete shambles, with too many unqualified staff, with no clear leadership. I photographed 15 staff just standing, chatting, while buzzers were bleeping, it was like something off a film set, with staff quite obviously at a loss as to their role. Even in an emergency, I would never go there again.nurses snappy and disintereste. ."
4527,
4104,I would give my experiences a 1 as it was a very good experience.
9599,"Neurosurgery - Great service - I spent few weeks in Addenbrookes after craniotomy and I cant find words to describe how fantastic service, Care And sympathy i received there. It was difficult time for me but everyone was so helpful and friendly. Thank you for saving my life. "
1220,"I went to the A & E unit of Barnet hospital with a sharp stomach pain and fever and I was seen by a doctor after waiting for 6 hours! The doctor prescribed me pain killers that were unsuitable for breastfeeding although I repeatedly pointed out that I am a new mother and breastfeeding. The pain killers contained codeine, a substance which is considered to be of high risk for newborns and should be avoided when breastfeeding. Not only I had to to wait for so long, being in pain, then I was also given unsuitable medication for my condition."
3353,Royal Brompton were absolutely fantastic. couldn't do enough for my daughter or myself. incredible x
8764,"Stroke - Fantastic Staff - I was admitted early morning & was taken to A&E where I was transferred to Shand Ward . The service from the Doctors, Medical staff through to the food servers were absolutely brilliant, I cannot thank them enough through these awful times, thank you Liz x"
8556,"In these awful times I just want to say thank you to the staff at Stoke Mandeville Hospital for the wonderful care they are giving to my mum who sadly is slipping away from us fast; palliative care now so days / hours away from losing a beautiful, kind and gentle lady!! üíî"

2806,STOP
6416,"Appalling! - Appalling failures in the Camhs service. I understand that mental health services are underfunded but not a valid excuse for lack of care provision for children. My experience in trying to get help for my Son has been one of a disjointed, badly run service, huge waiting lists & more red tape than NASA! Unfortunately I have come across health care professionals that simply do not care. Children seem to be a number, a statistic. If they don't fit in a box then there is no help. Improvements, funding, retraining & more robust standards are most definitely required."
9495,"A difficult experience made 10 times worse - We were referred to Centre for Life (CFL) by another consultant within the trust. We explained our circumstances at length at the initial appointment only to be told very rudely we wouldn't be helped. We had further appointments every four months where we met with a number of doctors of varying rude tones, but who all failed to show us any compassion. We were referred for some treatment at another service within the trust only to be told we weren't eligible (surely CFL should establish this). We were then wrongly advised by a locum doctor they felt we were eligible and it would be raised at the MDT meeting. We were never raised because the lead consultant disagreed - but we were not informed of this decision until we chased it. We called after having no contact and no scheduled appointments, to ask about testing that should be repeated following NHS guidelines. I called 4 times over 4 weeks. No one ever called me back until I managed to speak with a nurse who said ‚Äòwhat exactly are your wanting from us'. Perhaps we are wanting basic care and patient dignity? That is too much to ask from CFL. We cancelled an appointment arranged after this call due to the tone of the nurse and general distressing attitude of the CFL. There has been no calls or follow up contact now for over a year. I don't even know if we have been discharged from their service. They have made an already difficult experience 10 times worse than it needs to be due to their lack of care and compassion. It felt like they only care about results and their statistics."
7906,"Kind and caring, a lovely A team. Daphy (name) Lovely (name) and Nardy (name)."
2187,all the staff were extremely friendly and helpful 
6913,"Don't know - Great care whilst under so much pressure. - I recently was a day patient on the cardio catheter ward for a liver biopsy in the radiology department. All through, I had such caring, positive and helpful staff. I hear of the extreme pressure the hospital is under but I met calm professional staff putting their patients care first. Thank you. "
5312,Extremely unsympathetic and unhelpful - This was my second attempt to access the service. The first time I was discharged after a wait of many months because I was unable to begin therapy at the point in time the therapist became available. The second time after waiting abotu a year I began cognitive analytic therapy by telephone (due to coronavirus). In the first session I was told I would be required to specify my goals and I said I found this difficult owing to depression and struggling to envisage the future. In the second session the request was repeated and I repeated my difficulty. I was then told that I was not suitable for therapy and would be discharged. Because I did not wish to be left without support I said I would come up with something and offered some suggestions but the therapist said these were not valid goals and that she had made her decision and didn't have time to discuss it. This seemed especially unfair as she had begun the call 15 mins late. Throughout both sessions there was also something wrong with her phone that made communication very difficult. At my request she agreed to discuss the case with her supervisor and get back to me but all I recevied was a cursory letter re-iterating the discharge decision.
3939,Thanks to the staff @ConquestHosp Hastings today for making my oncology appointment more bearable. Mr Al-Nagar in particular. Thanks so much
5428,"Received excellent care. The staff are really, really good. Top notch! Thanks again."
2833,Sat waiting for a minor leg op at @RoyalLondonHosp. Feeling very grateful for the NHS.... https://t.co / JhnCrAeHkd
674,Friendly staff but too long of wait in A&E
9011,"I'm sure there's many good Doctor's, Nurses, and other staff who work at Burnley General Hospital, but there are many problems here as well. The number of times I've called a specific department I'm a patient at, only for it to invariably go through to the answer phone service. Are the phone never manned? Okay, so maybe they're busy. But I've left polite and informative voice messages with my issue, and have left a working phone number (a mobile) on several or more occasions, and I've not once received a call back. Honestly, how it this disregard for patient care and concern acceptable in a modern hospital. The NHS is quickly become a national disgrace and laughing stock, and I can see why, if Burnley General is anything to go by. I always remember that my late Grandma point-blank refused to go to Burnley General because of how she'd been previously treated in her later years (late 80's in to early 90's), instead going to Airedale at Keighley, because broadly speaking, it's a far better NHS hospital."
8623,"Don't know - Wonderful care throughout - My mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer a few months ago and has been undergoing chemotherapy and treatment from another hospital. She is in her 80's and has had some awful side effects of treatment for which she has attended West Middlesex for emergency treatment. The level of care shown to her has been outstanding throughout her visits - from A&E to the wards she has been looked after and treated with compassion and dignity by every person she has come into contact with. Her latest admission showed a partial bowel blockage which, although diagnosed by the other hospital, had not been fully acted upon. WMUH took her in, sorted her pain relief, diet, physiotherapist and home care packages, all basic needs and have been incredible - I would like to thank A&E, AMU, all the other staff too who have worked together to make her comfortable and happier than she has been in months"
9771,1 extremely likely  Very helpful friendly staff. We were seen quite quickly
2729,The servuce i received was efficient and all the staff were incredibke and compassionate
5164,If I ever actually manage to see my doctor he is lovely and very helpful. But my experience of dealing with this practice over many years has not been good. Perhaps all the negative reviews will encourage them to look at their processes and how they deal with patients.

9018,"Community care services - Audiology - Recently attended for advice on my hearing aids.A pleasant, punctual and informative experience.The staff were friendly, helpful and professional.Thank you."
8252,Dermatology - Excellent service - I attended the Dermatology department (area 4) last week for a small surgical procedure The appointment was on time and I was kept well informed of what was happening throughout the procedure. All the staff I encountered - from reception to the doctor and nurses - were very friendly and efficient. The department was very clean and there was plenty of seating in the waiting room. 
6339,
6058,"I was treated like a child who didn't know what was best for me. A midwife ignored my choice of not seeing a consultant and went behind my back to get another member of staff to convince me instead of going to arrange the aromatherapy I had been offered by the maternity led unit. Then they both lied about making a plan when really it was just a ploy to sneak the consultant in. A stressful event which is the last thing an overdue pregnant woman needs to get labour moving, especially considering how much they pester you for going overdue. Deeply upset by the treatment from this member of staff. Will be making an official complaint."
682,Great care received. Thank you.
9723,"That is ridiculous,, this hospital should be closed"
3484,I will be permanently damaged because of their negligence. A danger to the community.

7127,"I took my 3 year old toddler to A&E. There was a family in front of us who had a non urgent issue that they were looking into. Security decided to make us wait for over 20minutes instead of using his common sense and moving the family aside whilst their nurse looked into it. All I had to do was report to the reception. Obviously security have no idea of the concept of A&E. My child is unwell. I've taken her out at midnight to get seen too and we are still not physically in the building. If I saw someone with a small child in my arms, I would take it serious!!! I didnt get a name as I walked away and called the ambulance instead. DVH make sure the security company you use are trained up instead of being on a power trip. Its called A&E for a reason!! @security...don't be ignorant. Have empathy working at a hospital or find another vocation."
5957,"After having an injury to a radial meniscus tear and extreme discomfort for 3-4 weeks I organised consultation to Mr Andrew Barnett. He explained the problem and given my age we agree that pain management could be a short term relief however he details what surgery would be appropriate, which I chose. His team was extremely helpful, professional and empathetic to my condition and managed to get me booked in within 3 weeks. My surgery was well organised, totally professional and the staff in all areas were outstanding (at Oswestry Orthopaedic Hospital, Ludlow Ward). I strongly recommend Mr Barnett and he was totally professional, friendly and approachable. With thanks and appreciation to an excellent team of caring people."
8836,Thank you for mum's care
5982,"My Experience of CBT - Felt very down with low mood and a lot of anxiety. Thoughts were running through my head and dominating how I thought and the things that I did. Was missing out on events with friends and just generally feeling awful. I hated myself and was at an all time low. I was referenced to a Mental Health service through my GP and was on the waiting list for a few months. Then I got told that sessions became available to me with a great therapist. The sessions helped me to recognise and challenge the thoughts that I have about myself and really helped me to understand how I could improve the way that I think. It has been the beneficial thing that I have done probably in my life, as I can now challenge my thoughts and help myself do the things that I love to do with the most important people in my life. It helped to give me more of a purpose and give me a new lease of life. The therapist that I was with was heartwarming, kind and funny which really helped me through the experience. I now feel more relaxed in my own skin and now have the skills I need to carry on challenging the way that I think in post-therapy life. I couldn't recommend it more."
526,Maternity services - MATERNITY HELPLINE - Called the MATERNITY HELPLINE at 2.57pm today the 12th August 2020 to get my results back and Oh Boy! was the person on the other line moooody! She misheard my hospital number so I read it to her for a 3rd time and she finally gets it but she has the nerve to blame me for her mistake. Ridiculous. She then looks at the results and tells me what they are. Now I'm just trying to understand this so I ask her a few questions regarding the results but she just kept snapping at me and repeating the test result to me. Really rude and unhelpful. I end the conversation with a thank you to which she responds with bye bye bye bye bye bye. From the moment I spoke to her I could tell that she just wanted to get through the calls and end it all as soon as she could. I am still confused about my results FYI. Maternity helpline 
9725,i was looked after very well
5326,"I broke my left ankle on holiday in Scotland, and after being temporarily plastered, returned to England for treatment. I was looked after very well and had my operation that I needed . I was impressed with the care I received, and the staff were great."

9657,I had the privilege of helping prescribe the #COVIDVaccine this morning @StGeorgesTrust vaccination clinic. Thanks for making me feel so welcome.
4003,"Friendly, very helpful.Many thanks."
54,"Covid safety - I attended the X-ray department today . I sat down in the waiting area for over 15 minutes and at one point there were at least 7 of us waiting. I became concerned about the infection ie Covid, transmission .we were all wearing masks but as we Know This is far from full proof. I asked the receptionist if I could give her my mobile number and I would wait in the car until she text me. She wasn't interested saying there was only one person in front of me. Perhaps people who are in a vulnerable group / over 70 should be given this option. I noticed that although the clinic is open plan there was no ventilation whatsoever which is highly recommended re Covid spread. I realise life in the NHS is at its most demanding and I'm sorry to have to write to you but the potential spread of the virus is crucial to all of us. With kind regards...Mimoushka Cornu"
7656,First covid vaccine received after a long old night shift. Thanks so much to all involved @gloshospitals ü§ó
6684,"I have been coming to this Hospital for over 20 years. The care and staff are amazing. I have had 3 kids here, some serious DVTs, an elderly mum who needed frequent care and I have been so happy with the care we have received. The only thing that could have been better when my mum was admitted I needed to be here to feed her as I wasn't confident she would have been fed otherwise. That was a few years ago now though. Other than that, I applaud you Croydon University hospital. üòäüëçüèº"
8241,"Cataract Surgery - Exemplary treatment, thank you everyone - My 84-year-old wife Marian and I offer our most grateful thanks to every member of staff at Leighton Hospital, and at the Eye Care and Treatment and Covid test centres that we came into contact with in the past month as she went through a second cataract procedure. At every stage, whether we were undecided about which way to turn, or being dealt with by medical and administrative staff, the unasked-for response was either Can I help you? or courteous, considerate and effective treatment. Your Eye Care and Treatment Centres speak volumes for the leadership that has created such a first-class culture of compassionate and efficient care for patients, despite all the difficulties caused by the Covid pandemic. On our final visit, we asked two members of staff if you had a Staff Welfare Fund. Neither was aware that there is in fact one, and declined to accept an envelope with a small gift for it. Patients should be aware that they can express their gratitude by contributing to that fund. And if anyone has any worries either about undergoing an eye operation, or catching the virus, put them aside. You will be in safe, capable and caring hands. "

5774,General Surgery - Amazing care - I would like to thank everyone from Elective Care Centre to Wivenhoe Ward who looked after me when I had a cholecystectomy.

The nurse who placed the kunola placed it without difficulty as I have collapsed veins and the doctor who saw read my file and knew my issue in order to treat it. She asked me if I needed food to eat as I did not eat all day and then asked how I was going home at that hour in the morning (my husband was going to pick me up).

6527,"Crap wheelchair access - I have taken my disabled daughter twice in January for blood tests, now its upstairs the access is disgusting, I used the normal lift first as I didn't know there was a disabled lift, on leaving the to get back down I found the disabled lift so used it, when we got to the ground floor the door was blocked by an advertising board, with the help off a gentleman I managed to get out, I have had to take her again today 15th Jan, couldn't find the disabled lift at all had to squeeze into the other one, on leaving I noted where the disabled lift was upstairs, when we got back down using the normal lift I eventually found the disabled lift now being blocked by 2 advertising boards, this is just unacceptable, and the access upstairs is totally un acceptable for wheelchairs, I'm not very happy "
3003,"Accident and emergency services - Appalling, avoid if at all possible - Crowded waiting room, no ventilation. Waited 10 hours for various tests in A&E. Blood test results lost, had to be repeated. Then found out the blood taken was not suitable. Nobody came to tell me, had to go to ask why I was kept waiting for hours on end. Appreciate that Covid is a serious strain on NHS but lack of competence and communication at Lister is unforgivable. Consistently rated ‚ÄòRequires Improvement' by CQC. "

3911,"I gave birth at Rosie's a week ago to my boy a bit earlier than full term and we were cared for so well! Labour and delivery support at the delivery unit was impeccable. It's very tough to stay at the hospital after the delivery alone due to Covid and learn to care for my first newborn while trying to recover from a complicated delivery. But all the medical care, advice and moral support by midwives, nurses and doctors were fantastic, hospital facilities are also great with many things available to support the recovery and baby feeding."
7691,When I entered the Hospital I could use the Hygiene Station with ease then I was welcomed by one of my fellow Volunteers who was on Meet and Greet and the Hospital Receptionist who had a great welcoming chat to me.

Nurse came and did BP which I can do at home, you don't need to go to the hospital for the blood pressure. night doctors were talking about holidays, parties and watching wedding pictures but they don't care about patients. Some one from head should check them some times. The nurses are very good, helpful and Kind! "
225,"I have been a patient under the Barts Trust since 2007. There have been up and downs over those years, but in general I am so grateful for their (Barts Hospital and The Royal London Hospital) continued care. I have become a regular patient again in the beginning of 2020 (with 2 stays in the Neurological wards 12E and 12F) and again in 2021 (both wards). I can honestly say my experience with all staff at both hospital has been exemplary during this difficult (Covid) period. From my neurosurgeon Ms McKenna and her medical team of doctors, nurses and admin support. This applies to both the x-ray teams at both Barts and the Royal London (had numerous MRI scans over the last 18 months). On my 3 visits to The Royal London wards 12E and 12F, I have found the nursing and care staff to be so helpful and supportive. I can't praise the medical care I have received from both these two hospitals highly enough. This is a BIG thank you for all the NHS personnel who have got involved in my care over the years. Thank You all so much."

Rooms are spacious with plenty of space for personality room. additionally, key to room is provided, and there is a safe, to keep personal belongings safe key. Ward is acute without derogation of patients and staff are mixed ward. There is a zero in tolerance to equality because every review starts at zero.

721,"I will not recommend the orthopaedic department at the Lister hospital after the way they have treated my 23 year old daughter who for the past 14 months has suffered over one thousand knee dislocations and has been taking to the Lister hospital by ambulance on many occasions but today was the last straw and I will be reporting this department to our local MP, newspapers and PALS for the lack of care and empathy you have shown my daughter and us as a family. My daughter was c...onveyed by ambulance to your trauma department this Monday the doctor asked for a doctor from ortho to come down and once again examined and relocate my daughters knee as it was extremely swollen due to a join effusion the patella didn't relocate properly but the ignorant ortho doctors didn't bother to come down so my daughter was sent home only for less than twenty four hours later her knee to dislocate again once again she was taken into the lister this time the trauma doctor mentioned that the knee apart from being dislocated was hot and significantly swollen due to an infected join effusion and asked them to come down and aspirate it is know 3:00am and my daughter has been waiting and still they refuse to come down even though the trauma doctor has called them down twice . Words can't not express how angry my husband and I are with this department for ruining our daughter's life and ours having to watch her suffer everyday and to make matters worse I would like to state that my daughter works for the NHS as a call handler in London during COVID and had recently been offered the position of a qualified pharmacologist in a NHS hospital but because of their lack of care and empathy she will probably lose that position. I can't believe that you will treat one of your own the way you have treated my daughter the damage you have caused her mental health is Undescribable I'm sure if I waved a cheque for another twenty thousand pounds you will be more than willing to come down and look at my daughter's knee .

2213,"Birth experience during covid 19 - I went in to have my daughter at musgrove park hospital on 30th april via c-section due to being overdue & unable to be induced due to previous complications with my first pregnancy. I was welcomed onto labour ward by a very friendly member of the team who showed me & my partner to our room. I then shortly after met the midwife who would be tending to us that day and she was lovely & friendly which put me at ease instantly. Every single one of the team members I met throughout the time in hospital were phenomenal! Informative, friendly, reassuring & pleasant! My surgery went well and we welcomed our beautiful daughter into the world. My partner got to stay for a few hours afterwards which was great and then he left as I was transferred onto fern ward. Despite the crazy world we live in at present it was so easy to forget as I spent time bonding with my new baby. The ward was quiet & calm and it was lovely! The midwives really took the time to tend to your every need and make you feel comfortable! No ask was too big which was great whilst being a little immobile. My first child the labour was intense and left me feeling very anxious about this delivery to then be topped off by coronavirus I spent the last few weeks extremely anxious & nervous but from the moment I arrived I couldn't have asked for a better experience. All the staff are a credit to the hospital & I cant thank them enough for helping me bring my daughter into the world."

Arrived at a&e had my eye looked at under a faulty slit lamp was told by the Dr that they could see better without the magnifying glass. So he just used the lamp and his own eyes. Sent home with no other test done. Not even a blood test. Also wasnt told what was wrong with my eye. Given no answers at all

1997,Amazing vaccination service - I had my vaccine here yesterday at the St Thomas vaccination centre. I was extremely nervous and very tearful but all the staff were so kind and lovely to me. The person administering the vaccination got one of the nurses to come in and hold my hand while I had the vaccination and they were so calm with me even though I was very upset. I am so sad I cannot mention them by name but hopefully they will see this / feedback will be given to them and they will remember me from my lamb! Thank you ever so much for being truly amazing.
3397,"Don't know - First class care in Thomas Ward - My frail, elderly mum who had dementia was recently admitted to Thomas Ward. The care and compassion she received was absolutely wonderful. The staff were all so kind and understanding. The communication from ward to family was brilliant too, we were kept informed every step of the way with daily updates and we were told we could ring any time, which we did and it was never too much trouble. When we were allowed to visit Mum in her final days the ward staff and palliative care team were all so kind and considerate. The ward was spotless, the covid safety measures were all fully explained and easy to follow. I honestly cannot thank everyone enough. They made what could have been a stressful and traumatic experience into a calm and gentle end to a beautiful life. Thank you. "
9180,Urology - Leigh urology department - Thankyou to the girls who done my bladder and bonus prostrate examination today. Was dead nervous but after wondered why.

4930,"Don't know - The worse ever experience with A&E hospital department - Our son 22 years old was transferred from West Middlesex Hospital after having a stroke and we couldn't even see him or leave for him personal essentials. The A&E female receptionist didn't even show any understanding or compassion. Clearly the covid 19 rules are more important than patients and their closest family members rights and feelings. We heard that we are not allowed to see in person our son at any time and the only option is a video call. We believe that is so unfair, unhealthy and we are going to make an official complaint. "
9905,"I recognise hospitals are under significant pressure, but I have had 2 unacceptable experiences within 1 month at St Georges, Tooting. I submitted a formal complaint over a month ago thro' official channels for an initial appointment but no response received despite numerous hasteners.

2508,"Adult Mental Illness - Disgusted with regime of bullying and punishment - My son was recalled back into mental health care because he 'felt well' and was refusing to continue with Clozapine medication which was causing many side-effects. He has now been detained and had his section renewed for some 10 months against his will while doctors try to 'pressurise' him into going back onto the medication which clearly makes him feel unwell, and while they experiment with other medication options. Having requested Christmas leave for him with prior notice this was rejected by the Doctor during a review but family were not informed until we went to collect him on xmas day. As a result my son subsequently absconded and is now being punished simply for wanting to spend a few days with his family. This regime of granting leave and then taking it away as a punishment regime HAS to BE STOPPED My son feels bullied, and is angry and upset by the treatment he is currently receiving from the doctor and my fear is that this may unfortunately reduce his chances of recovery. As a parent I am very concerned with a hospital which deliberately seems to exclude family involvement / support as we feel this is a key factor in his potential recovery."

They gave me the same meal, every-single-day! The nurses were really kind as I could hear all of their conversations even though I was in a comatose state. Shout out to nurse Paulina, I hope you get into Harvard soon! Finally, the reason I died was the janitor accidently tripped over the breathing apparatus keeping me alive and just simply forgot to plug it back in. So I just want to say I forgive you dude.

7934,"Absolutley disgusted with the antenatal staff, so rude. Dont recomend this hospital to anyone"
2026,"In the past two weeks I have had had to use the NHS for two different family members. First experience 30th December 2019 At 6:12 am I received a call from my mother (71 and an asthmatic) saying just two words ‚Äúcan't breath‚Äù, so whilst I was getting dressed my partner phoned 999 and I jumped into the car (I live just 2 minutes away). The 999 operator said there was a wait of around 40 minutes for the ambulance, but to my surprise when I arrived at my mothers house the rapid response paramedic arrived. (Exceptional and he was absolutely fantastic). He spent the next 20 minutes stabilising my mother, putting her on a nebuliser and gave her the option to go to hospital for treatment (nice to have a choice) and we felt it was for the best she goes as she had 3 similar asthma attacks recently, so we hoped they would be able to run tests to find the root cause. The ambulance arrived within 20 minutes from the point he requested it, again another exceptional experience of the NHS, the care the provided was exceptional. My mother was then transported to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital at King's Lynn, there she was held in the ambulance at to front of the hospital for around 3-4 hours. Initially she was told she would need a flu swab before entering the hospital, for that she needed to wait for an hour (despite being told it would be around 20 mins). From a selfish point of view it was great that she had 2 paramedics monitoring her whilst she waited to enter the hospital, but then looking at this from the view of someone waiting for an ambulance, to think that there are two highly trained paramedics just waiting to handover a patient when they could be giving life saving car to someone it seems like a huge waste of resource. Whilst we were waiting in the ambulance there were another 5 or 6 ambulances parked at the front of the hospital and I assume these were waiting for similar reasons to us. Once my mother had got into the hospital, she was given an chest X-ray and then discharged to her local GP and has now been told there will be a 6-9 month wait to see the consultant - which given she's 71 with a worsening condition could mean that by the time that time has passed she could be dead. So a great experience at one end of the NHS but let down at the other end. Second experience - Sunday 6th January 2020 Earlier this week, my partner herself experienced breathing problems and a pain in her chest, having had a cough for a week or two. She's 41 years old and a frequent runner, who generally runs 10-20 miles per week. I could see she was suffering and couldn't wait for a doctor so we called 111 for advice, after a number of questions the 111 agent advised her to take an aspirin and advised that an ambulance had been requested, so given she said she had chest pain, it seemed to me that the agent thought it could be signs of a heart attack The ambulance again arrived within 20 minutes. At 2:50 immediately put her on an ECG machine, took her blood pressure and oxygen saturation. She was then taken to the QEH at 3:40am and when they arrived 20-25 minutes later, again had to be held in the ambulance for approx 2 hours, another huge waste of time for the two paramedics. (who were great). By 5:30am she had been taken into the hospital and was put in a corridor for the remainder of her visit and only had her blood pressure taken by a nurse once. She then didn't see a doctor until 10am at which time she was put on a nebuliser and was given steroids via an IV drip. In this time she wasn't offered any food or drink and was finally discharged around 12:30 with no further medication The following day she still wasn't improving so we visited our local GP, who said she had a chest infection and was prescribed with steroids and antibiotics. Her condition is now improving but she said she never wants to go to QEH ever again after receiving such poor care and I hope that will be the last time."
3534,Professional staff
8671,"Really cannot thank the staff of the Ambulatory Care ward enough for their care of me over the weekend. I witnessed first hand their patience with idiots throughout which they remained calm, professional and above all caring. A brilliant group of people doing amazing work under very testing conditions. Please if you are unfortunate enough to have to visit this or any other hospital treat the staff with kindness and humility, everything they do is in your best interests and if you have to wait a while, try to remember its because someone else's need is medically greater than yours no matter what you think."
6361,"A complete disservice to the NHS. I'm so sick of their disinterest and lack of care across the numerous departments I've encountered now. Our more recent example is we had a gorgeous little girl premature who received excellent care from Jessops in Sheffield. Unfortunately we fall under Barnsley catchment area and as she weighed 13g over their extremely low weight number for any follow up care from the neo natal team (Sheffield is a whole half kilo more) we've been abandoned onto our GP who quite honestly are out of their depth and already overwhelmed. It's our daughter who pays the price as we struggle week after week to manage issues this hospital should be looking after. In addition, we're still waiting for to hear about booking any of the standard follow-up care for a baby from Barnsley hospital, but as they don't seem to care about their local residents I I assume it won't happen without some kind of begging phonecall."
2637,I have been answered all of my questions and got best care under the team. Loved going to the appointments to know everything is going well with myself and my baby. The team is great.
8294,"Attitude of staff to older patients - In both Newark and King's Mill I am a reasonably intelligent and well educated woman of 78 and still have my marbles! Remarks made in a friendly and intelligent way to members of staff are sometimes slapped down by a condescending and patronising response like bless you. I am pleased to see the rainbow outside the hospital as well as all the work to combat racism, and any lack of respect towards disabled people, but it seems that it is considered acceptable to treat older people in a patronising way. I feel that this is ageism and I suggest that training should include forbidding certain words and phrases as responses to a patient's questions or remarks."

I arrived post surgery on a ward where I felt comforted and reassured. I would be there for 3 weeks having told my wife I would be gone for a maximum of 3 hours. The staff were absolutely amazing. The surgeons, the nurses, the auxiliary staff, the domestic and catering team, the administrative team ( post discharge ) .. thank you so much. A most impressive team and group ethos is present within St. Michael's. I so want to mention one staff nurse in particular and I shall contact the hospital in some other way to name and praise.

This has happened multiple times and I don't understand how a place can have such bad organisation. The reception never seems to have my name on the list of visitors despite always scheduling the appointment after seeing my therapist and this causes great stress. Not happy in the slightest.

All the staff are amazing with him, including consultants and anaesthetists. We would choose Barnsley every time, and would highly recommend it to others"
3127,Had a good informative discussion with the consultant
2122,"I have been here a few times for appointments and I have to say the staff, nurses and doctors have been patient, kind and professional. Each one has made the visit as comfortable and un awkward as possible. The staff has been wonderful and I have observed how they deal and react with the number of visitors. Well done! "
3235,"Accident and emergency services - Superb - Brilliant service, and a very short wait too. I arrived with a hand injury, was seen within 45 mins, x-rayed and put in a cast. I can't speak highly enough of the treatment and service I received. Thank you "
6188,"Thank to all of the Newborn Feeding Team on Castle Acre ward and the Frenulotomy team. You gave me time and a listening ear, but most importantly you gave me the support we needed to continue with breast feeding. An amazing, valuable team."
639,"We wanted to say a huge thank you to the team at BCRM as we have just welcomed to the world our angel daughter Srushti on May 09 2020, our little ICSI miracle. We are so so grateful for the care and professionalism received by the team at BCRM. Each member of staff are such an asset to BCRM, a special mention to Dr Abiruchi Paisal who will always have a special place in our hearts for being utterly amazing. We had given up hope as we had tried 3 Cycles before as well. Special mention about Dr.Abiruchi here as she consoled us and gave us the hope and confidence to go ahead with the cycle here . She used to call back and answer our queries on need basis with patience though she was always busy attending to patients. 2020 has been a very tough year and during this pandemic BCRM had taken good care of the Mom and child and we got a feeling that we are in safe hands always. What an amazing team, thank you for making our family complete. Kudo's to Dr.Abhiruchi and the team and a big standing applause from our family for giving us the most memorable and cherished gift of our life for us. Bristol and BCRM will always be remembered by us for ever. Thanks a lot from bottom of our heart Rajya and Bhanu"

8949,just one phone number for outpatients appointments - It may seem petty and non medical but there must be hundreds of patients trying to get through on one number for appointments. I tried for two days and was informed by a robot I was 15th in a queue. Costly to me and very frustrating.
3663,The service was very good the nurses and care I received was brilliant thank you
9070,"It took 2 3/4 hour to be seen, thats all. Rest has been impressive, physio called within 10 hours of being dismissed & first appointment that afternoon."
8422,Update. 1 pm. = 33 hours in a freezing A&E waiting for a bed. 1.30pm. discharged herself. Will try KCH. @LG_NHS YOU ARE A DISGRACE.
4059,1 however the car parking was extremely bad. It took me in excess of 30 mins. Fortunately I had arrived early and was therefore not late for my appointment. It was not possible for me to use public transport to get to the hospital. | Whist I rated the treatment and staff 1 the car parking was impossible
4651,You have misunderstood my opinion. I commented Very Good. That should be sufficient.
4928,"Attended the paediatric ED with my son on Sunday, Nurse Erin was lovely, she put my son at ease and explained everything she was doing. The doctor ( who's name escapes me ) was also great, informative and honest. As a ward sister at UCLH, I was impressed at the speed, professionalism and caring approach myself and my son received. Thank you! "
4110,Big thanks to the staff at @UHP_NHS minors for looking after my 9 year old boy tonight! Very caring and got down to his level to calm him! Thank you

1887,"Just had my jab at Fareham Community Hospital. Wow, what an efficient system, and so friendly with it too - you are doing an amazing job! Loads of volunteers in and out the building keeping the flow of people safe and moving through. Makes me proud to be British! Thank you."
5101,I go here for blood tests and its quicker than the other local hospitals
6540,"My dad's been in the hospital the past few days‚Äînot with COVID, though he did get tested. It's been‚Ä¶unnerving. Anyway, I just called home to talk to my mom to see if he was leaving the hospital today‚Äîand I don't know if I've ever been so happy to hear my dad answer the phone."
7102,"Such a nice hospital with respectful staff and nurses and doctors, they are well mannered and deserves the appreciation in what they do as their job role."
2900,"Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery - Great experience - I recently had a wisdom tooth removed under local anaesthetic and was quite nervous prior to the procedure but shouldn't have been! The experience was very smooth and painless, the team very professional and great at putting my mind at ease. Would highly reccomend! "
3651,"Most shocking treatment I've ever had. If you have a big 11mm spikey kidney stone which is stuck in your ureter (3-4mm) causing agony don't come here. Asked for painkillers 5 hours ago, several times, Dr's have been negligent and tbh waste of fkin space! @NorthMcrGH_NHS #teamNMGH"
2060,What a long 24 hours. Before after and finally now on the sofa. Going into hospital and having to have an operation when you're on your own due to covid was actually really scary. I'm glad to be home and resting now. Big thanks to the @HullHospitals staff who kept me calm! ‚ù§‚ù§ https://t.co / P10y0dAwXj
6405,Accident and emergency services - Excellent care - The team provided my elderly father with life saving assessment and treatment for sepsis. The Sister was very kind to me on the phone. He remained stable following their intervention and continued to have great care on Ward 14. 
294,Brilliant staff and excellent customer care looked after me fantastically despite being very busy.
8411,The timing and the service were all very good
6091,Excellent cares
2353,"Unprofessional and felt that I did not matter. - I had a telephone appointment with a staff member at 9am via my home phone. At 10am . nobody called. On the fourth attempt, someone answered the phone at reception and said that I had been booked in for 9am. When staff called to provide me with my consultation, they said that they were an hour late in calling because they had been discussing a case with a colleague. No answer was given when I asked them why nobody had bothered to call me to say that they would be delayed but that my appointment was still running. To omit to call anyone, let alone a mentally ill person to say that you are going to be delayed is not only the height of bad manners it is also highly unprofessional. I have been left with the opinion that this careless attitude gives me the impression that they thought that it was okay to leave me hanging as I don't matter and that I am just an NHS number that doesn't matter until something awful happens to me. Absolutely disgusted and I am still very distressed about this. I have a good mind to submit a formal complaint."
159,"From how wonderful the paramedics that took me to the Royal, I knew I would be in good hands. I went to A&E and was processed into the Acute Medical Unit. The staff from nurses to porters, from doctors to cleaners were exceptional. Very courteous, always helpful and so human in their approach. No matter what illness, what background you are from, patients were treated equally and with the greatest respect. I can't thank them enough for helping me through my illness."
1236,15 years ago I spent this night @EvelinaLondon with my then 4 month old son. I slept on that drop down plank by his cot and Santa came in the night and left presents. Never heard a thing. 15 years later he's in the lounge with his Mum acting the fool. Love to @NHSuk https://t.co/AVuqwggzJr
7777,"Gynaecology - Amazing staff ‚ù§ - Ward 40 ... an absolute pleasure to be in hospital, every single member of the team involved with my care; consultants, doctors, theatre, and ward staff, you're all so lovely and really do care, lots of time and patience, proper old fashioned nursing ... the best hospital in the world, thankyou, much love NHS üíô"
7501,"Thanks so much to all at the Cumberlege Centre who looked after me this morning, it was much appreciated! "
6838,The staff went above and beyond and were so hands on. I was treated like royalty. From entering to even leaving the care i received was second to none. Everyone was so friendly. The nurses were attentive and really took time with each patient. If I have to go in hospital again Grantham would be my first choice.
909,I had the best treatment from everyone | Thank you very much
7447,"Stroke - Wonderful treatment - A family member, was admitted to the stroke unit, late one night. Due to the virus the staff did every test, scan etc. within a 24 hour period. We couldn't have asked for better treatment and care for her, she was back home within 48 hours. Had she not been treated so quickly, we don't think we would still have her. She is the mother of 4, and 2 of the children are still dependent. Thank you staff in the stroke unit for Saving my daughter's life. We will be eternally grateful."
7866,"Covid swabs much nicer than anticipated, thank you to the lady who did my test at the CEC today @UHNM_NHS"
7012,"Don't know - 'SIMPLY THE BEST' - I attended this hospital at 8.15am for a colonoscopy, I was greeted by a very caring, friendly receptionist who made me feel at ease and not just a number. Everything moved very quickly and efficiently by all staff, I cannot praise the nurses & surgeon enough, I have attended many hospitals but Bishop Auckland is the very best all rounder & I thank them all for making me feel like a human being."
8512,"Amazing staff! - Over the past few months I have been back and forth from the hospital with a complicated miscarriage. I had appointments every two weeks at the EPAU and always felt every time I went back the news got worse. Without the reassurance and all the love the staff gave to me it would have all been so much harder. They made such a horrible experience just that little bit easier and I could not be anymore thankful. I then had to spend a few nights on the aleksandra ward and I can honestly say all of the staff was so loving, they made you feel extremely comfortable and was there any time I needed them. Any time I needed any kind of reassurance there was always someone there to give it to me. I've never met such amazing, caring staff. I definitely recommend this hospital. "
3808,This does not open at 9 on a Sunday. Apparently has been told several times and is still advertising that they are open at 9! 
14,"Just had a minor procedure in the plastic surgery day case unit at St Helens hospital @sthknhs - so impressed by the calm, friendly professionalism (and very decent tea)! "
9501,Because the moment I arrived to when I left I was handled politely and professionally. This is why Im prepared to travel all the way from South Devon to Guildford for my treatment.
3464,"Don't know - Results never sent to GP (Andrology department) - My husband has a fertility test done on the 6th November, and the results have still not been sent to our GP. Our GP clinic has emailed twice since then and called but there has been no response. We have called several times and left voicemails but have not heard back from you. Please can you contact us to let us know when the results will be sent to our GP as this is an incredibly stressful time for us. The lack of control and the situation we are in is already causing us severe anxiety and stress, and this process has added to our emotional distress. This is the second time this has happened using this service (first time in October), although the first time someone picked up the phone eventually and was able to get the results to our doctor. This time there has been zero response from the clinic to us or our GP."
3475,Clinical Treatment 
4558,Really pleased with the care received at the Royal National for my son who has an unusual condition called MSUD. The paediatricians and psychiatrists have been attentive and caring when it comes to helping him although the admin staff can sometimes be difficult to deal with. This is a very testing condition for a young person to have to live with and overall I am happy with the medical side of things so far in our visits to the Royal National.
9079,"The staff at A and E were so kind and efficient and caring. Couldnt have asked for a better experience, especially in such very tricky times."
1692,"Arranging patient contact during Covid-19 - My loved one suffered a stroke and was admitted to the Shand ward. After one week I requested a visit but they were not allowed. Upon further enquiry, I was informed that a virtual visit could be arranged and this was promptly facilitated. In the interest of patient care, it was brief. Definitely, this is important for wellbeing and rehabilitation. I would like to commend the Shand ward and its administration for thinking not only of the medical needs of patients but their holistic health-mental, emotional, spiritual and social well-being. Its also good for the family."
3699,"I had a giant swab stuck up my nose today. FOR ME, it wasn't that bad. BUT, I can definately see how some people might go through the roof. As a side note, the COVID team at St.Michaels Hospital in Toronto are top-notch."
3873,I cannot fault the care I have had from all staff at hospital during my stay in CCU.
1719,The market (stall) economy in the #NHS - fruit and veg stall at the entrance of my local hospital (#calderdale (far from) royal). Expand on new revenue streams to fund paper-heavy service. https://t.co / aQ3RhdZ8Hg
9882,Super care at A&E. bad information flow from fracture clinic afterwards. I was left in the dark.
8843,"Maternity services - Forced labour no pain killers and emergency c section - I was admitted on Monday, starting an endless process trying to dilate, up until Wednesday, I was in extreme pain and Ward 7 only prescribed paracetamol; when I broke waters crying in pain, they decided to apply epidural who took 2 hours to arrive. Thursday 7 am started shaking; high temperature; Doctors took until 9:45 to appear and say baby was at risk rushing me to an emergency C Section; leaving me and the baby with antibiotics for 24 hrs. Avoid this place."
5977,"I went with my best friend to clinic 4 as I want waiting, there was a gentleman on a trolly all alone and a very kind specialist nurse by the name KELLY BARLEY went up and attended the gentleman and stayed with keeping him company I was pleased that T.L.C. Still exists thank you clinic 4 for helping a couple to clinic way out of there way and the kindness Emily üòäshowed my friend a credit to the hospitalüè•"
4969,"Awful Practice - Terrible front of desk service. Having dementia makes it difficult to remember when to call but the receptionist showed no compassion when I asked for a telephone appointment and the next available one was two weeks away. The closest actual appointment has 7 days away. The doctors have lost my notes, sent confidential information to my daughters school and frequently failed to offer any support other than pills. They failed to diagnose me for other illnesses after frequent appointments without a referral to another doctor or to a consultant. They gave me a scan which I was told was all clear with no follow up appointment only to be informed that the scan given wouldn't give any information to suggest everything was 'all clear.' If you have any option, go somewhere else. This practice is full of disappointment. "
4562,"I unfortunately had to have an ambulance called out on Thursday and I just wanted to say a huge thankyou to all involved. I have a chronic medical condition and was in a very bad emergency situation where I had no choice to call an ambulance. Firstly even though the staff on the phone were swamped they never made me feel that I was being rushed. Claire and Kelly were the amazing paramedics that came to treat me, and they were just fabulous. My condition is pretty rare but the...y had done their research before hand and were really keen to know how I usually get treated so they could manage my pain and work quickly. They even stayed with me and worked with the District nursing team so I could stay at home and not be in hospital so I could be comfortable (and avoid putting pressure on the already busy service). I just wanted to give them a special shout out as they are an amazing example of how fantastic this service is. Thankyou so much! "
9110,excellent service. excellent professionals. Thanks to all the professionals at Hillingdon Hospital who took good care of my daughter M√¥nica during treatment against covid. God bless everyone with health Always.
5037,"Really poor administration, we were phoned by Drs numerous times about appointments times and then no confirmation in writing of times until chased and then only given the day before surgery at the pre op which we only found out about because we kept chasing. Then on top of this there was no bed available in the ward that was in our letter so sent straight down to surgery answering questions in a lift, So terribly organised. The ward that was eventually on left the cannula with 3 tubes coming off it in arm and no medical communication or attempt to communicate to relatives as a handover of a patient with"
9074,"Gastrointestinal and Liver services - Dreadful communication skills of some administrative staff. - Patient at the centre of a breakdown in communication between 2 hospital trusts. Informed by email that surgery was to take place 2 days before a pre -assessment telephone consultation. The patient needed to change warfarin medication, arrange a covid test, be assessed in 3 working days before surgery. West Middx point of contact was unhelpful, didn't have relevant telephone numbers and didn't seem to care. Contacted the other Hospital trust, ( responsible for pre-assessment) which was sympathetic and has agreed to carry out the procedure as originally planned. The telephone answer service at West Middx was off putting in tone. Sadly the patient was unable to speak to any medical professional, apart from a phlebotomist, who was responsible for her particular field and no other. Left with negative feelings about West Middx Hospital and a sense of relief that the procedure will be taking place elsewhere."

233,i would recommend the ambulance service usually they are all brilliant. except for last night after a paramedic failed to book my 8 month old prem baby in after she had rolled off our bed and banged her head. we was left sat in the waiting area for hours and nobody even knew we was there because they didnt do the handover! when i confronted doctors at the hospital why i was still sat waiting after numerous children was in and out being seen my daughter had no obs done or any...thing the whole time we were there waiting because they were all completely unaware we was there and had to retake our details... not to mention the paramedic was falling asleep in the back of the ambulance on the way to the hospital.... all paramedics do an amazing job but last night couldve easily been avoided if anything wouldve happened to my daughter those paramedics wouldve been held responsible!

2976,#Hospital excellent quick-turnaround documentary @bbctwo that should be made essential viewing. So impressed by the dedication of the @RoyalFreeNHS staff and the resolve of the patients featured. So many stories left untold.
525,"Investigation following bowel screening test - Having completed a number of these test over the past years, I was quite surprised to receive notification of an anomaly, following my latest in early May. I received a letter, explanatory booklet and follow up phone call from Guildford to discuss the situation. I was happy to proceed with the investigation as it was obviously for my benefit. The procedure went very smoothly and was carried out in the most efficient, professional and friendly manner. I received a follow up phone call, as promised, with the results which were fortunately negative. I have nothing but praise for the way I have been treated throughout and would recommend any person with a similar diagnosis to utilise the testing procedure. Thank you NHS."
7535,"Terrible service - I was booked in for an appointment at 11.40am. I was advised not to arrive until the time of my appointment due to COVID-19 restrictions, I arrived on time and was temperature tested and signed in. This took me three minutes over my appointment time and I was refused my appointment. No budge with reception staff just told I needed to book another appointment. I'm unsure if it is lack of training or just poor people skills. "
1080,I attended for my 20 week scan today very nervous (due to Covid 19 there are understandle measures in place which means you have to be alone) however from walking through the door all the staff are very helpful and caring.. There were two women doing the checks at the front who were both so lovely which instantly made me feel at ease.. The lady who did my scan was amazing! The baby is a wriggler and was in awkward positions but the lady persisted to reassure me she was all okay.... She made me feel so much better I can't thank all the staff enough for still going to work everyday during these times and yet more caring than ever.. I've wrote this to thank them ‚ô•Ô∏è and to reassure others that going alone isn't as scary as I thought it would be üòäü•∞

8865,Don't know - Fantastic hospital - In November my relative was admitted to ward A2 suffering from Covid. The care she received from all the doctors and nurses who looked after them was wonderful. They put their lives at risk everytime they enter a patients room . Despite being short staffed due to staff illness with Covid or isolating they always entered a room with a smile which showed in their eyes. They young person who bought the food round tried to coax my relative into eating or drinking something and was very kind. I can't thank you all enough for the care and compassion shown to my relative and because of your care I have my relative back home. Thank you xxx
8672,It is concerning that although Suffolk has a low incidence rate according to Chitchat - of a small seaside town- a little girl (doctors daughter?) is in Ipswich hospital with covid 19. It's still about and no time to lower our guard

5471,"Physiotherapy - Pelvic Health Physiotherapy - I was referred to Pelvic Health Physiotherapy by my gynaecologist as I had a very weak pelvic floor. I am so pleased with the help and encouragement I received. I had been nervous about attending, but there was no need to be. I was seen each time in a private room and treated by a lovely physiotherapist who was very kind and understanding and explained the exercises I needed to do and how to do them correctly. The exercises were increased over several visits, until I was confident I was doing them properly. My treatment has made a world of difference to me and I only wish I had sought help sooner. I would recommend Pelvic Health Physiotherapy at North Manchester General to anyone having problems. Many thanks."

9914,"Don't know - Phone not answered. No published email addresses - I have been unable to have phone calls answered, just receive a message stating the person you are trying to contact is on another call or away from desk, try phoning again later. Spent an hour this morning getting same message from both the Orthopaedic Assessment service number and the main switchboard. If one can not contact via phone why are email addresses not published? How are you supposed to contact the hospital? I have been waiting to receive a report following a referral for X Rays which was performed on 16th July, it is now 13th August."

I spoke to the office, they had no interest in helping me, and told me painful dry eyes was 'normal'. I was not told this before I paid! Be warned - laser eye surgery can also lower your quality of life permanently."
5811,I was greeted and told exactly what to do to check in and to hand sanitize and where to sit. Very organised.
2420,I had to be given two intravenous antibiotics as ordered by cramlington hospital over the weekend and ward 1 very kindly agreed to do this to to save me two long journeys just for 20 minutes work. Very friendly staff. Credit to the hospital

The service provided to me was a Lovely experience with one of the staff he had a wealth of experience, he was very kind and helpful. He ensured I had a smooth appointment. I am so glad for the service provided. Please pass on my compliments to this service."
645,Cardiology - Fantastic staff - I have recently been diagnosed with heart failure that was found at the RVI's A&E assessment suite. I was transferred up to the cardiology department shortly after my arrival at A&E. both departments were absolutely fantastic in the way I was cared for the medical staff and support staff are so professional in what is extremely difficult times. I really can't thank everyone enough for the help I have been given both during my stay and the aftercare I'm receiving now. Myself and my family are extremely proud to have such a fantastic hospital. Thank you.

4422,very very good my girlfriend had her 1st physio appt there today jan 8th 20. and found it to be a very well organised hospital. with clean immaculate toilets etc. i do so hope the powers that be decide to keep it open. especially after cheadle & moorlands hospital in leek had some of their wards and services discontinued. these smaller cottage type hospitals are vital and are still very much needed. macc can be a long wait and north staffs is so big it can be an issue. so KEEP KEEP KEEP these smaller town hospitals running. dave hall 59 from leek staffs.
8914,My daughter was admitted Sunday 23 August 2020. We were treated well and seen relatively quickly given that it was a busy weekend at A&E. The nurses on Jungle ward and the doctor we saw were very friendly and compassionate. Thank you all ‚ù§ (Winter-Evelyn's Mum)
3763,"Incredible staff - Went into labour at RHCH the two midwives looking after me, my partner and our new born baby were incredible one of them only being a first year student who was beyond knowledgeable and very informative with everything that was happening throughout.

307,The service was really good and quick at first with the X-rays etc but took many hours waiting for the results
7884,I'd like to say a massive THANK YOU to the ambulance crew that came to my care on Friday 18th December. I'm sure there names were Will and Jackie?

7440,"Accident and emergency services - Ignored for hours - I took my wife to A&E after she collapsed at home and banged her head. Following advice from out GP I took her straight to A&E. Upon arriving there were no staff available to check her in and I had to wait over 5 minutes for someone to appear. Initially things went well. We didn't have to wait too long to be seen by a nurse and she was admitted directly to the ward for assessment and tests. After an ecg and having a cannula placed she was then left unattended for hours. FIVE members of staff dedicated all their attention on the drug addict in the next bed, even leaving the ward to buy him a can of Coke. Whilst he was getting all the focus she vomited 15 times, was shivering cold and had nothing to drink. Eventually a staff member gave her a small cup of water and said they would return to sort her after my wife complained she was cold and uncomfortable with the bed in the position it was. Needless to say she didn't get a blanket or any other form of care until eventually she was dismissed and told to collect her meds from the pharmacy. The staff didn't even bother to remove the cannula from her arm before sending her out to wait for me to collect her from the waiting area. Overall very poor care. Disgusting that staff would go buy drinks for a drug addict and completely ignore the patient in the next bed who was groaning and vomiting. I find it unacceptable that my wife was shivering and cold for hours because no staff member could be bothered to check on her and provide something as basic as a blanket. At the very least they could have checked regularly if she needed anything to drink! We have used other departments at the hospital which overall have been excellent. Such a shame that the team on duty at A&E today seemed to only care about certain patients and fail to provide even, what I would consider, minimum care (water and a blanket) to others. "
3080,General Surgery - Seen quickly - Referred for an assessment and with discussion with Doctor it was recommended to have surgery this was done the same day and within the hour. Excellent service and the Doctor was very personable.

7090,Appointments on time. Excellent professionals cared for my dad today. Thank you
7819,"Great experience and staff - I have been a patient at Moorefield's for a few years now and have always and have always received an exemplary service at both Tooting and City Road. On 20/04/2021 I had a corneal graft at the Tooting practice. At first, I was quite tentative about the procedure so done my research prior to the operation. That meant I had a great deal of questions for the surgeons. They were more than happy to help me with any queries I had settle my fears. The surgeons, nurses and support staff (transportation and admissions) were all highly informative and supportive each step of the way. The covid prevention measures also contributed to a general feeling of safety whilst on the ward. As well as suffering from Keratoconus I have blepharitis so was worried about the recovery period. My first appointment post-surgery was a few days after which showed a significantly faster recover than was expected and the physical appearance has improved dramatically. I would highly recommend this service to anyone who requires corrective eye surgery.as I got the impression everyone was working as one strong team. "
9616,"An example of exemplary care - My wife was admitted to Resus at Musgrove about half an hour into Christmas day. We had already been supported brilliantly by a first responder and paramedics. On arrival the Resus team was calm, thorough and entirely focused on the task. At the same time they were warm, responsive and human. This quality of care continued in the Acute Medical Unit. My wife is a retired nurse and I have worked all my career in health and social care. We know how much pressure the system is under and the difficulties that the NHS is experiencing but this has been an example of exemplary care, committed staff at all levels and a system that focuses 100 percent on the individual."
6868,This hospital Is proof of the failing NHS over worked understaffed underpaid under motivated nurses
2580,Didnt visit as had telephone appointment via the video link arrangement. Brilliant
2810,"Eye - accident and emergency services - Exceptional service - I attended the Brighton eye hospital A&E 24th August 2020 in the afternoon and my overall experience was of the highest standards of care, nothing was to much trouble, the staff were very supportive from making my own personal telephone referral in the morning, giving me a time to attend the appointment up to helping me fill out my admission form on arrival which the reception staff took care of because of my visual problems, which has stopped me from being able to write my details . The triage nurse, the nurse who carried out my assessment and the Doctor in charge of my case we're excellent in all that they did and knew exactly the treatment I needed, eye scan, drops to dilate the eyes etc and the doctor conversing my diagnosis I was given all handled in a first class way, and I was treated with the respect that I was a human being not a statistic thankyou to the staff who handled my case Mr B Alexander "
161,service and respect was faultless
9526,The nursing staff are very good & it has a high standard of cleanness.

7659,"I arrived just before 9am with a very deep puncture wound in my leg. Once I was registered I was seen by Emma who was absolutely first class. Having checked with me on discomfort levels she cleaned, glued and steri strapped the cut / wound. I also left with very clear instructions on what to do over the next few days. I was also impressed that Emma phoned my doctors surgery to make sure my tetanus injection was up to date. Brilliant all round thank you so much to everyone."
9128,"Very angry with @NHSNLaG (Grimsby) My treatment is not working, in just over 2 years I've reached double figures in admissions (ICU & HDU) in that time I've seen my consultant once. Today I've had my next appointment cancelled (multiple cancellations this year - pre Covid)"
5135,Everything always seems so well organised. Everyone helpful and friendly. Also felt Covid safe.
9558,"Incredibly grateful that thanks to @Jbdempster1976 that I can self infuse at home. So many @HAE_UK patients have the independence to self treat at home, to be safe & avoid A&E where possible thanks to immunology CNS teams across the country, worth their weight in gold @uclh"
9843,"I had two children here; number of issues with clinical care first time round and clinical oversight and substandard care second time that led to my having an early C-section. They missed a preventable illness, despite my presenting with risk factors and questioning the results of tests on multiple occasions as they were above the current guidelines. As investigation later showed they hadn't updated their guidelines and it was explained to me that the midwives didn't have time to keep up to date with the current guidelines. It was also evident after delivery that different departments used different guidelines. The large size of the baby wasn't picked up till last few weeks of pregnancy, so I missed out on growth scans and adequate antenatal care, leading to an early c-section as deemed the safest option. Other than that, in my experience, they are rude, blame the patients for all their errors and oversights, and with a couple of exceptions, in my opinion, most of the midwives are poorly suited to their jobs. One wasted the whole appointment trying to do chit chat and not talking about anything relevant and then just ticked off the boxes on the forms she was supposed to go through with me. When the following time I asked if we could go through stuff, she pointed to it and said We already did, see I ticked it off here. She still works there, last time I dealt with her she was giving out incorrect clinical information on maternity helpline. They all still work there, all beyond reproach. Their management say they are busy and overworked. Chaotic, shambolic, you name it. Generally, I witnessed a culture of matey-mateyness, covering up and indifference. Breastfeeding support zero, midwive care after section zero, they just they lie to you, etc. With first child, I had to walk 2 miles while in induced labour to buy painkiller as they wouldn't give me so much as paracetamol, having convinced me to go for an induction and promising epidural very early on in labour. Later on, after many hours of labour, the anaesthetist, who was a star, but seemed to be shared by the whole ward being the only one there, started on my epidural, then had to leave for an emergency, returning hours later, leaving me in horrid pain with no pain relief for hours. And so on, how long have you got."
7581,"Old Age Psychiatry - Great staff- very caring - My mum was admitted to Ward 2 a few weeks ago under Section, we were very scared. I live in the states and my brother lives in Asia and because of COVID it was a struggle to get here to support our Dad and our mum but I got here a couple of weeks ago. The staff on ward 2 have been incredibly caring and helpful. Even though I'm sure receiving up to 4 calls a day about mum must be annoying - they have been nothing but welcoming and patient. I even got to see mum in the garden and then again for a short visit in reception. We are so happy with how she is doing and the care she is receiving. This is a very difficult time for our dad but knowing how well she is being cared for takes a huge weight off. Again, I thank the medical and social work staff I think you are all brilliant. I feel better about returning home, but will be back soon to help with whatever is next."
3121,1 except for parking!  I was seen exactly at the appointment time and finished in 15 minutes. Not what was expected!
4022,"Accident and emergency services - Very dissapointed - Extremely disappointed with rude and insensitive behavior in A&E. I had to rush my husband to A&E on 11th August night as his heart rate was rapidly increasing after a small surgery earlier in the day (at another hospital). When I went to A&E, one particular lady at the entrance was extremely rude and insenitive. I was told that only patients are allowed inside (due to COVID-19) which is absolutely fine and I completely appreciate it. However, after leaving my husband, he came out again near the entrance as he was experiencing symptoms so wanted to get his BP checked. I went towards him to check if he was okay but I was shocked at how rude the lady behaved with me and my husband, especially at a really vulnerable time for us (and particularly my husband). She said you are not going to jump up the queue if you stand here and stare right at our faces. Again I appreciate the pressure that the staff are facing with the current crisis but that doesn't give you the right to behave so rudely and insensitively with people who are going through an extremely scary time in the A&E. The doctors inside were very helpful though. "
4755,"The NHS is for life not just pandemics. Went to a Saturday pm joint injection clinic. @Leic_hospital, great staff & service. 2 patient DNAs, excuse was shopping. 10 weeks ago the nation was clapping NHS heroes! #NHSheroes #NHS"

4665,Absolute disgrace
9351,"Hospital repeatedly refused to respond to my complaint until MP got involved Three times over 6 months Kings refused to respond to a justified complaint, namely my reasonable request that they retract their false allegation that I failed to attend an appointment. Each time I submitted the complaint, Kings acknowledged receipt but failed to provide a substantive response: Kings did this 4 times over 6 months so it was clear I was deliberately being discriminated against. Kings is aware that by refusing to respond to complaints, the matter cannot be escalated to the Ombudsman. The hospital unreasonably and repeatedly refused to communicate with me, I asked for evidence to substantiate their allegation and got nothing. I therefore made a subject access request; they had no option but to respond by the statutory deadline. There was no evidence to back up the hospital's allegation. I also found numerous serious data breaches, internal notes in which Kings staff referred to me in disparaging terms, etc. When I challenged this, I received a terse response from Kings telling me to ‚Äúgo to the OIC if you want‚Äù. Well I did better than that, I got my MP involved and within 24 hours, Kings relented and provided written retraction of their false allegation ‚Äì which is all I had asked for. I am enormously grateful to my MP who was able to put an end to this discrimination by Kings. There is no doubt in my mind Kings would never have responded had she not got involved. Kings' parting shot was to claim they had copied my NHS GP on the written retraction (which I needed so I could get the false allegation removed from the record held by the GP). I personally went to the GP to check this and GP confirmed Kings did NOT copy her on the retraction as claimed. Presumably Kings thought I would not check. So I provided GP with a copy of Kings' written retraction and after 7 months of unnecessary distress, was able to get Kings' false allegation removed under the provisions of the GDPR."
5656,Exceptional. No waiting. Promised a dietician would call me today and they just have done. I feel (felt) so cared for. Thank you.

1268,The staff at the northern general hospital work tirelessly and to be honest I couldn't do what they do the stress levels at times must be going through the roof and they make it look too easy and just keep on going and that's just the A&E department. As for the rest of the hospital starting right at the bottom and alway to the top they all just go about their duties as if nothing was happening. I've been in this hospital a few times from what I would call basic surgery to complex surgery on my spine so for this I thank you from the bottom of my heart. But and I mean a big BUT the nursing staff are second to none and seem to go about their duties as if on auto pilot nothing is too much trouble for them even the awkward patients again I sincerely thank you for all you did for me on my admission to the hospital you are troopers and if there was no nurses there would be no NHS so all you ladies and gentlemen you are amazing and dedicated staff.
6654,Disgusting staff rang them to discuss an injury and due to covid wasn't sure of the proper procedures and was greeted with a rude and uncaring member of staff that put the phone down on me after giving me no information. Worst care I have ever received in my life.

Can not fault ICU in any way! Massive thankyou to all the staff who looked after me night and day. A credit to this hospital as the staff work as a team and pass information clearly to each other. The care and attention helped me massively in my recovery after having a planned resection operation. Massive thankyou to all the staff in ICU. 
6442,Absolutely disgusting the amount of time they make you wait with no update! Yes we get we've all got to wait in a queue and the services are pushed to a limit...aren't they always even pre covid! But at least advise people a length of time...its a service we are paying for at the end of the day....people would complain if they had ridiculous waiting times when going out for food so how is this any different! Literally sat for just short of 40 minutes with not one person being called in! Why! 
2623,This hospital has the worse A&E ever. Very very very poor. Lacking management. Extremely slow. Hospitals in 3rd world countries have better service.

I went to a&e as I couldn't breathe ( covid patient ) was put in a wheelchair in a corridor which is the same corridor ambulance staff come in and out of so the door constantly open. I was absolutely freezing which didn't help my condition. Eventually I managed to ask a nurse to move me elsewhere she moved me back to the waiting area where I was left again for hours. Finally when I was seen the doctor told me I needed to walk faster bearing in mind I was oxygen and felt like I was having a heart attack, I was then vomiting. They didn't admit me into hospital. Few days later I was taken by ambulance to another hospital where it was discovered had I been left any longer I would have developed sepsis, I had pneumonia and my kidneys weren't working. Ended up on a respiratory ward. Oldham hospital your staff are incompetent, rude and to say this is a caring profession you show no signs of it. Totally unsafe practice."

The triage nurse was warm and welcoming, the junior A&E doctor ordered x-rays, which showed blood in the knee joint. The Consultant in A&E reassured me the x-ray was normal, he syringed off blood from my knee joint and gave me crutches and I was given a fracture clinic appointment on Monday after the weekend. He explained the procedure carefully, made sure I was comfortable and paid attention to keeping the site sterile (he was teaching the junior doctor at the same time), and the procedure was painless. Afterwards the pain in my knee was greatly reduced. The consultant was very considerate of me as a patient, and put me at my ease. The care I received on the NHS was prompt, thorough and outstanding. I could not have received better care privately, and I am very grateful."

2412,Maternity services - Amazing service & Staff - We had to bring our delivery date forward by 4 weeks... From the moment we arrived I was made to feel special and received the very best care from all the staff in maternity. We were treated with dignity and the staff couldn't do enough to put me at ease. Regular check were completed with a touch of humour and a smile and communication at every step of the way was faultless. It was great that I had a particular nurse who nurtured me through the whole process and was there when I came round after the anaesthetic. The surgeon has performed a C section and delivered our twin boys. We can't thank you enough for going above and beyond. The after care on the mulberry ward was brilliant and I commend all the staff for their excellent service and professionalism.Thank you cannot express our gratitude and appreciation to the maternity team for providing the care and support during a difficult time like Covid.

I had filled in my paperwork, been seen and got my prescription within 15/20 mins. Perfect thanks."

5665,"I fell off my bike and dislocated my shoulder yesterday, and thankfully I was near this Urgent Care Centre. I walked, and before I could even explain what happened to the receptionist, a practitioner saw my shoulder and rushed me into the first open bay. Within 5 minutes, my shoulder was snapped back into place. Within 30 minutes I had x-rays taken upstairs. And within 45 minutes, the entire ordeal was over with and I was on my way home. Along the way, I was treated professionally at every step. I'm so grateful to have had this accident so close to such a great centre."

7306,"As a devoted hater of all things hospital related recent visits to West Beks have been fantastic. Quick appointments, friendly staff, superb service, light airy building and plenty of parking at a reasonable price (1 for 2 hours, so reasonable it undercuts the bus fare 4 times!). Can someone please replicate this to most of the other hospitals in the area? "
276,Maternity services - Worst discharge centre - I been waiting since 9am chased it at 11.30 the after lunch and then 3 and then 4pm the midwife response is that my notes is locked and they don't have a key this is a joke. So no time of when exactly i will be going home. I know hospitals needs beds so why don't they discharge quicker so that people can clean and have the bed. Don't get me wrong they are all helpful but they need to move there arses. Also waited a whole day before i seen a doctor when i was admitted the night before.
1408,Very thorough. Kept me informed about what was going to happen next

3844,"Car parking chaos at LRI - Car parking at LRI continues to be in chaos and at time a complete farce. Today the queue goes back into the bus lane on Welford road, and take 55 minutes to get into the actual car park. Because of the car park improvements which I think look like about 3 weeks work, have now been going on for 6 MONTHS. This looks bad on the Estates management but is probably the fault of their contractor (s), but they should still chase this up and get it open & working as its very long overdue. I believe that the main problem is insufficient capacity due to the staff parking on site where they would normally have to park elsewhere, and because they arrive before the parking wardens arrive, they get in for free. The wardens estimate that a large number of staff are parking for free, so patients & visitors cannot get a spot to park, leading to long delays & cancelled / delayed appointments. Can someone responsible for this farce at LRI get their finger out and resolve it, as this shows LRI in this area to be incompetent."
3994,The waiting is very long for emergencies however when they realised I could potentially have serious problems they did act very quickly and did the tests to make sure I was ok.
8282,"I love the NHS and RCHT. They have saved my family yet again. The compassionate GP at St Agnes saw my 10 month son and I first thing when I walked in without an appointment visibly rattled. Within minutes he had a thorough check over with reassurance and a letter to speed me over to the hospital. We had expert kindness throughout the day with all the blood tests, x-rays and cannulas. It's been scary in places and I had big flashbacks to when my second son had meningitis. We fo...und out he has a rip roaring urinary infection and pneumonia and needed IV antibiotics for a couple of days so we made a nest at Treliske to recover. Now just home on oral medicine and hoping he turns that corner soon. I am so full of gratitude we are cared for so incredibly and no thought to a bill or insurance. Just our baby's welfare. Please let's fight for it, protect it and all the truly amazing people who work day and night, going over and above everyday, to ensure that deeply compassionate thread in every patient's story. Thank you. Thank you."
6909,"Geriatric Medicine - Parking only uses cash - We no longer handle cash and found that we can not pay for the car park. We had to go to Lymington town, to the shop to obtain cash. This is against NHS and Government advice and recommendation. It is regrettable that the hospital can not follow these guidelines. "
1906,I was seen really quickly and was given an excellent service
2699,"they took me for back surgery with only one sign. It's been 4 months and I have pain in places that never hurt. My left leg didn't hurt at night before the surgery, but now it hurts day and night while sitting and walking. I wish I hadn't gone to that hospital that night. yes nurses are nice and helpful. but I can't say that for the doctors and the hospital. I am very sorry. now i have pain and i can't work. they don't care at all. How many more months can I last like this? I refer you to God."

Finally I had my stent removed on the 12th Dec 2019. I would particularly like to say a big thank you to the doctor who was very calm and patient with me. Rukhsana Khanum

7502,"Just had heart surgery, Done in 3 day, thanks to all the staff."
3108,"Accident and emergency services - It was ok - I attended A&E with severe flank pain over the last few days. Suspecting kidney stones, I was advised it was for the best to attend the hospital. I was ushered to Urgent Care where I was asked to complete a urine sample. My blood pressure was 144/99 (I am only in my 20's) and there was ++ blood found in my urine. I was met with a nurse who suggested I may have pulled my back, but to be sure, could I do another urine sample? I obliged and she came back and advised that there was only a little bit of blood found however, I had used the toilet not even an hour beforehand without being offered anything to drink so it didn't surprise me that there were only 'traces'... surely blood isn't normal in general??? She asked if I would like some co-codamol and to go home or be seen by the medics though they may not see me today. I said I am here and have definitely not pulled my back so please, ask the doctors their opinion. They then came back and advised that I was to go to A&E to be assessed. I have to say that this is where my experience got a little better, though I found the newby doctor quite patronising, he did get me some morphine when my pain reached a whole new level. I was then transferred to ASU where I have to say, the nurses and surgeon that I saw were very pleasant. I was advised that I did not have to stay but would need to come back the next day for a CT scan. I am now awaiting a urology appointment in two weeks - I can't fault the ASU or nurses that were there that day. My only issue was with urgent care - I feel like the nurse in charge did not want to listen to anything that I said and was happy to make me leave that day with painkillers that don't do anything for the pain. I hope they do better for the next patient. "

But is that nurse doctors and receptionists are really rude, unpleasant, unprofessional and very disrespectful. I just saw a man with a panic attack for 3 hours without receiving help .. It seems inhumane to me what I have seen in two days only. I think someone should control this mess. Panic attacks can be anightmare I know from experience and what that man is going through is a horror. They have taken it to the door as if it were a disco. by god this is a hospital! I feel ashamed of the little human treatment offered here and I hope I never have to step on this site again in my life. I would not recommend anyone to go here."

8497,The worst hospital ever the Doctors are literally useless. The staff is horrible and scary. The porters are unhelpful. The only person kind to us here the cleaners. The A&E department staff are least bother on how serious the patient is. People if you are bleeding or you can feel a Tumer growing in you please avoid this hospital. They will not attend you untill you are about to die in few days. Run for your life seek help else were and stay away from st. Helier hospital. It should certainly close down. Useless creatures work there. Deeply regret the day we left hospital after been convinced by doctor that we will be receiving ai letter in 2 weeks for scan thinking it can be cancer or TB. But the letter arrived after 3 weeks and by that time it was to late.

4465,5....I waited over an hour!! It was better organised during lockdown. Sorry | I have a timed appointment. Of course can wait awhile but over an hour with no explanation!!

Thankfully, it was not something as serious ad a stroke and we drove home mightily relieved. NHS staff have much to put up with all year round but never more so than at the moment with Covid-19 rearing its ugly head. I am so pleased I clapped on Thursday evening, little did I know I would need your services! Thank you one and all "

4378,i would recommend the ambulance service usually they are all brilliant. except for last night after a paramedic failed to book my 8 month old prem baby in after she had rolled off our bed and banged her head. we was left sat in the waiting area for hours and nobody even knew we was there because they didnt do the handover! when i confronted doctors at the hospital why i was still sat waiting after numerous children was in and out being seen my daughter had no obs done or any...thing the whole time we were there waiting because they were all completely unaware we was there and had to retake our details... not to mention the paramedic was falling asleep in the back of the ambulance on the way to the hospital.... all paramedics do an amazing job but last night couldve easily been avoided if anything wouldve happened to my daughter those paramedics wouldve been held responsible!

6618,"Not great for me personally. - Have known someone who enjoyed their experience so this review is just based on mine only. However for me it hasn't been the best. The first time I used this service the counsellor laughed at the drastic change in my scores for anxiety / depression on the questionnaire. Also acted like I wasnt engaging when I actually felt I wasnt being listened to or understood. The second time round after waiting a few months for an appointment (which I understand is standard due to the pressures the NHS faces) I called up to say I cannot make my 1st appointment as I was in pain - so instead of rescheduling, I have been put at the beginning of the waiting list AGAIN. There are definitely areas to improve - in both the service and how it is run, and I hope this is thought about for the future."
4551,"The staff at this hospital are amazing - professional, compassionate and understanding. I saw other patients treated with genuine kindness also. The AEC staff in particular are spectacular. HAPPY"
6464,"The staff were friendly and professional. The Dr's and nurse was very courteous. Explained everything in detail and a pace people can understand. Dr Nazar and Dr Srinivasan were brilliant. Their dental, Thomas, dealt in an extremely friendly way with my son who going to be treated."
3858,Very efficient.
3735,"Blood test the 2 staff at the reception were unbothered to help, completely ignoring the patient and staring at the computer, over the phone before going to my appointment today they were very unhelpful and disinterested. The lady at the x-ray reception was very helpful and lovely though. The 2 girls from the blood test need to learn how to interact with their costumers!! "

From the arrival and pre consultation care and diagnostics, to the clear and easily understandable explanation of the problem and treatment plan.

3015,Found the doctor to be completely apathetic and really question how much he was actually listening to what I was saying. Dont feel he explained how things would progress over what time frame but seemed very keen to discharge me. I didnt feel like it was worth questioning him any further.

9437,"Urgent Treatment Centre - Efficient / proffessional service - My wife and I were staying in Penrith for a couple of nights and unfortunately I swallowed a fish bone (at breakfast time) and after visiting a pharmacy it was suggested that I should visit the MIU. We arrived at the unit at 10:00 and by 10:45 I'd been assessed / seen and we'd left. The service from start to finish was very efficient, professional etc but I should also state that all the staff still had a very reassuring'bed side manner' The advice that I was given appears to be correct as the problem seems to have gone. I have to say I wouldn't recommend the unit as I would rather people didn't need to go BUT if anybody needed assistance then I wouldn't have any hesitation in recommending the facility / unit. This unit is a credit to, what I believe, is the true worth of the NHS. Thank you"

4996,"Bad experience continues - I left a review for this mental health clinic not long ago ( march ) when i had an awful experience with them, being pregnant and not receive help for 6 month in my pregnancy. In the end at the end of my pregnancy the dr called me and we had a long conversation when she decided that my situation is very bad and i need new medication. I asked if medication are safe as i was still pregnant and planing to breastfeed as well . She said yes . 2 days after i receive app from my gp that i need to go and make some blood tests as the dr from crombie house recommend ( she never told me about this ) i refused as i was in lockdown being pregnant and by then the corona virus was really bad . Anyway i contacted Crombie house and i asked for dr to call me, she did call me after couple of days and she decided to not start new medication till I don't give birth ( was just one week left till my planed c-section ) and then she said she will contact me 1 week after i have the baby to advice me on new medication and see how i am . Now they pass 8 weeks from when i had my baby and i still haven't received absolutely no phone call or new medication, I stoped my old one as advised and now i am a new mum and struggling lots . This is unbelievable to treat people like this when we should receive help! This is the worst clinic i even had to be treated by and i do not recommend them at all! "

9720,"I recently had a call back following a screening mammogram. I was very impressed with the service I received in breast services. The speed at which I was seen, biopsies done and the results given to me was extraordinary, especially given the present circumstances. Special mention must go the radiographers who really struggled to position me to obtain the biopsies due the awkward position of the suspicious area. They were professional, patient and kind throughout. Breast services should be very proud of the service they all provide. I am a particularly discerning customer as I was Service Improvement Lead for Cancer Care in my last job. Luckily for me the results were negative."

3415,Pain Management - Excellent care - I visited this department today and was seen by an excellent consultant and a truly lovely nurse. They were sympathetic and went to great care to explain things thoroughly and candidly. I felt listened to and treated with compassion and understanding. They were both encouraging. Too often I've found trips to the hospital can be a bit dehumanising and I certainly didn't feel that today. I've got a clear treatment plan and I understand what happens next. Thank you to both these practitioners for a good experience.

On Friday a care plan was discussed for discharge for Saturday, She was moved to f11 late Friday, I phoned on the Saturday about her discharge and f11 had no papers sent to them with the information they needed so she couldn't be sent home. No communication at all between the 2 wards, an absolute disgrace. My mum has dementia and became more confused after going in hospital. She is medically fit and better off at home, how this happened is disgusting and very unfair on my mum, I think they need to get their act together! "

I had to arrange a Teams meeting in order to speak with him. This was after; * Failing to notify me for 4 weeks (as second next of kin), and having to be told when one of the other patients lent him a mobile phone. * Telling me that he was at Calderdale Hospital (which he wasn't) and diverting my call to a dead line. * Refused to allow him to contact family (by phone or other means). He is not good with tech / computers at the best of times. When I did manage to get a Teams meeting, the nurse didn't bother to check whether the connection was sufficient. I could only see the drawer unit next to his bed and could barely hear him. When I hit the function key at my end, the nurse accused me of swearing when I mentioned 'hitting the function key again' and disconnected me. I phoned back. Asked the receptionist for the address and she was very rude and curt. I'd been told it was the Huddersfield General Hospital. She said No it isn't it's the Huddersfield ROYAL (she shouted this) Infirmary. I asked her for the address. She asked if I had Internet. I said yes and she said Well look it up then! . Her whole tone was rude, abrupt and discourteous. They failed to listen to or answer any of my concerns or questions, rather evaded answering them."

363,"Sleep Medicine - Insomnia Service is amazing - I received regular, one to one telephone support from an experienced therapist specialising in Insomnia.I was sent videos to watch with clear guidance notes, and discussed with the therapist. The Insomnia therapist took time to listen and understood how my insomnia affected me. Through careful guidance I learned how to make changes to my current sleep pattern. I was given the tools to recognise and change my thoughts and sleep behaviour. There was no pressure, and gradually I started experiencing better sleep. Insomnia was affecting all aspects of my life. Low mood, fatigue, migraines. Since receiving support from the Insomnia service, my sleep has improved. I feel calmer and definitely feel more positive for my future. I only wish more doctors were aware of the incredible benefits the Insomnia service offer to people suffering, and referrals were sooner. It does take practise but sticking with it, and using the support tools has given me a positive outcome."

Come the day and time I logged-on and was made very welcome by the Fern team and other participants even though I was the only male present. I am so pleased that I decided to opt in as what followed was a wonderful hour on conversation, a mix of personal stories, humour and non-judgemental chat. It was an opportunity to talk openly about our individual cancer journeys without embarrassment with others who understood the highs and lows ‚Äì something not always easy to do with those who sere not travelling a similar journey. It is anticipated that this will become a regular fortnightly event which I would strongly support as it helps our feeling of well being, provides an opportunity to make new friends travelling the same journey and combats loneliness."
3329,"Visit to the sleep unit - I have been attending this unit for several years and am provided with a CPAP machine (my second) I have found them to be caring, Knowledgeable and very helpful should I request spares or adjustments these happen promptly. It is sometimes difficult to get through by 'phone but that is understandable during Covid as it's the same everywhere else. "
8434,"Urology - Excellent - This hospital, the staff and the quality of care is second to none. There is a friendly, caring atmosphere amongst staff. Staff members remember patients which shows how dedicated they are to their jobs. Hospital spotlessly clean. Patients seen promptly. You never hear staff moaning about their jobs or their equipment as I have done in other hospitals. Plenty of parking. Patients are treated with respect and kindness from the doctors through to the nurses, porters, trainees and cleaners. I cannot recommend this hospital enough. My review is written based upon many visits to the hospital. The management team in this hospital are a model that should be used in every hospital as they are clearly doing something right. Well done."
7341,Amazing staff and efficient service. Im extremely grateful to the Dr and nurses for the care I received. Especially during these difficult times.
6081,"Everything went very smoothly, no problems."
9394,The department looked well organised and clean. The Dr. seemed to be quick and thorough in seeing the patients so not long to wait. The only negative I have that it was too hot in the waiting room. Thank you to all the NHS I think you all do amazing!
4834,
1019,So excited ... have just checked in @GSTTnhs been pre screened by a wonderful nurse and now waiting for the vaccine. Can't believe I am so happy to be in a hospital ....

4932,"I have had this procedure at The Royal Surrey for several years staying overnight. Whilst I am very grateful for this to have been done at this time there were several times I felt my experience fell short of professionalism on this occasion. Mislaid medical records, temporarily Mislaid my own medication. No pressure stockings put on prior to having anesthetic. Nurse in recovery put them whilst in recovery. A few more problems resulting in my comment."
4464,Don't know - An efficiency model for all other hospitals - I attended the Radiology department for an X-Ray and I was a total of 15 from parking my car to getting back in it. Someone within the NHS needs to look at how this department achieves such a high level of efficiency (and be the most pleasant NHS staff into the bargain) and build their method into an overall Efficiency Model - and I say this as a former Quality Director of a National Company. Well done Clifton! 
3284,"Fantastic experience at RSH Day Surgery unit, very professional staff. I was well looked after and felt completely safe. Thank You so much to all the staff, you are amazing :) | ** some text is missing ** ff, you are amazing :)"

The whole experience from the phone call to the end of my appointment was an excellent example of our NHS at its best, it was safe, informative, caring, friendly and professional and I would like to say a big thankyou to the staff who looked after me. I also got a follow up letter just three days later confirming the results I was given and outlining future follow ups. We are so lucky to have our wonderful NHS in all departments."
7201,Excellent practical help and advice.
9225,"Not having to wait long was a great relief. Mr Logan was a charming, knowledgeable Consultant who made one feel at ease."
1712,Just a little slow at the beginning
7328,Accident and emergency services - Excellent service - I was admitted to the RD&E with severe chest pain on a Monday evening. I was immediately taken to resus where two senior doctors started emergency treatment to stabilize me. They contacted the cardiac consultant who came in at midnight and carried out angioplasty to remove two blood clots and insert two stents. The professionalism care and consideration could not have been bettered and I owe this team my life
6429,I was extremely happy with all the expert care I received at RSH. Thank you.
8487,I literally hav PTSD from my history with Lewisham hospital but Last night was the 1st time in my life I went to @LG_NHS lewisham hospital and I felt safe! No ignorant staff No freezing in my bed No being ignored No ridiculous waiting times. Just simple unbiased patient care.

1848,So comforting - I would definitely recommend this treatment and service to those who struggle with daily life and need some extra help to get them out of a rut however for long term trauma or long term sufferers cbt maybe needed to reconsider however I can not review how there other processes work as I have not been able to try them

484,I was born in the John Radcliffe Hospital in the year 2000 and so far my life was pretty good.
1520,"With imminent covid third-wave, staffs are doing their best to keep everyone safe."
8374,"Sort out the administration - Honestly they are extremely friendly, but unfortunately the results need chasing sometimes . I had to pop back over to chase my results, waited about 20mins and a nice lady came with an apology and said we have experienced problems but I have your results to hand . So yes people get your admin in order."

6180,1 very impressed | All the staff were friendly &helpful made me at ease explained everything to me & dealt with me efficiently. Very happy couldnt fault anything about hospital at all
5276,Is a fantastic hospital.However please don't leave someone who is in pain being vomiting without fluids even if they are nil by mouth. I appreciate trying to get a doctor to sign off on meds and fluids can be difficult but 12 hours is silly to go without any fluids.
2050,"Spend a day on their Day Care Ward for loads of much needed testing. Ramp entrance with wheelchair aid button, just incase the ramp was too steep for a wheelchair user. On entering the hospital I was politely greeted by a hospital worker of whom took my temperature, asked me some Covid-19 question and asked why I was attending today. After the check were done, another hospital worker was kind enough to show me where the lift was and told me whivh floor I needed for the Day Care Ward. On arrival to the Day Care Ward I was asked to sanitize my hands once again, temperature was checked, form was filled in prior to being taken by a staff member to a side room for some more indetaied questions were asked, observation done, then then plan of action regarding my day ahead was eadily explained before he made me a lovely cup of coffee. Every procedure I had done during my stay on the Day Care Ward & other area's of the hospital were conducted with care, consideration, friendliness, help & understand. All staff were friendly, polite, they made sure that I totally understood every step of all of my procedures and were happy to give them written consent for the Lumbar puncture procedure. The hospital was spotless in all the area's I attended, hand sanitiser was widely available and face masks had to be worn during my stray. I would Highly Recommend this hospital, Day Care Ward & other area's, where I needed other tests conducted. Thank you for making my day a very relaxed time especially due to having to undergo so many procedures."
754,Extremely efficient. As soon as I turned up I was sent for an X-ray and within 15 minutes of my return I was seen by the Consultant.

545,"I've waited over 10 hours so far to see a doctor about suspected appendicitis. What is wrong with this place?? Vonited into a bin after 9.5 hours waiting, and no-one said or did anything. No-one around to ask or communicate information. Literally the worst A&E I've ever been to."

1396,"Cardiology - COVID 19 problems - Forty eight hours before my appointment in Cardiology today I did as requested and sought a COVID test, which I'm glad to say was negative. On arrival at reception E, I was asked if I had taken a test. A young lady presented at reception and was asked the same question, she replied no I haven't taken a test, and then after reading a notice handed to her took two seats along with her partner next to me all be it at distance. Her partner did leave after she persuaded him, this is despite notices stating patient only seating. A young man then approached the same receptionist and no mention was made of a test at all, he also took a seat. My point is with the COVID-19 numbers in Bedford rising I have done my best to stay safe and protect others, whilst your hospital is apparently prepared to let me sit next to three people who could potentially be carriers of the virus. I have no idea if this was a oversight of the receptionist or a management error With walk in testing availability in Bedford, I would suggest no test no appointment "
8466,"Everyone at the department were very nice, considerate and very thoughtful of individual needs. All so professional in their duties and making sure I understood all taking time to explain, I cannot think of how it could be improved"

5660,"Don't know - Poor practice - Staff were arguing about mixing up a patient's COVID test and lo and behold I got a call to come in and do another test as my test was not done correctly, so clearly there is some sort of incompetence in this service. I then returned and found that all the staff had gone for lunch, should the staff breaks not be scattered so patients do not come in and find nobody in the department? This has left me with no confidence."

4718,"Imaging department-worst ever-do not go there!!! Wrote to Yana Richens -head of midwives after a re-assuring talk with her-never replied. Wrote to the director of the hospital-Siobhan 2nd time-never replied. Was booked for an induction on Sat as apparently the ward was supposed to be empty. Slept only 5 hours 9months pregnant to attend for 9am appt which was dragged till 3pm! (so why was I given a 9am appt then?!!!), only to find the ward full and short staffed.... Was given hormones to start induction and the baby ended in distress and emergency c -section....that I never ever wanted.... Please do your research in advance, as I did mine after and found out that those inductions almost always lead to c-section!!!! The staff at the labour ward have a lovely attitude and are lovely, but was told today I am staying here (1day after c-section) only because of the baby! -Provided that I am in agonising pain, can't walk and have been having even night follow up checks.And was told that my husband has to leave although I am highly dependent on him because of this ridiculous c-section that made me like a disabled person! We found out that staff give mixed messages and don't really know what they are doing.... Still waiting for post operative instructions that were supposed to be given to me yesterday.. I was told that This maternity department is small and therefore full.Not to talk about scan intervals-rubbish.... Last time I gave birth at Northmid hospital and highly recommend it.... Avoid Whittington...."

858,"Staff too busy laughing and joking to serve customers. I'm disabled and they kept me waiting for a cream. There was no queue. After waiting they told me that they didn't have it in stock and I need to come back the next day. When I told them that I couldn't they told me that they'd send it to my local pharmacy the next day. The next they they called and told me that it wouldn't be going out as they missed the collection, so I could collect it after 3pm the day after. I got someone to go and collect it and it wasn't there! Told to come back the next day. Tried calling the pharmacy, only to get a fax machine. Ridiculous service, nothing like the local Lloyds pharmacy! A total let down."

I‚Äôm not blaming the nurse for my experience she was nice about it, I spent nearly 4hrs going to the doctors then through to A&E and I still don‚Äôt actually know what‚Äôs wrong with it only what it might be so the poor experience is probably harsh but just how I felt over the whole issue. | Maybe give me a little bit of information as in rest it, keep moving it, exercise it, what‚Äôs actually wrong with it etc."
